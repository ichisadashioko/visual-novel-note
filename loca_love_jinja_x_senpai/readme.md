<ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> doesn't sound like a 先輩 at all. <ruby>主人公<rt>しゅじんこう</rt>の<rt></rt>名前<rt>なまえ</rt>は<rt></rt>葵<rt>あおい</rt>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby>. What's a boring name!

<ruby>沢越<rt>さわごえ</rt>月川<rt>つきかわ</rt></ruby> is the <ruby>神社<rt>じんじゃ</rt></ruby>'s name. <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> was being taken photos? That sounds really weird - the sentence I just wrote.

<ruby>紫月<rt>しづき</rt>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby>. <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> sounds like a really common name.

<ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> is really short. For some reasons, I felt deceived. Look at this PR image.

And here is how <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> looks.

<ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> looks like a middle schooler to me. The PR image had completely deceived me.

<ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt>の<rt></rt>部屋<rt>へや</rt></ruby> was flooded for whatever reason. His parents went oversea due to their works. <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby>'s families had closed with each others for a long time so <ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby> came to live at <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt>の<rt></rt>家<rt>いえ</rt></ruby>? That sounded like very lazy world building in a few lines of text. <ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby> had been helping <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> with the <ruby>神社<rt>じんじゃ</rt></ruby> works. <ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby> only worked at the <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt>の<rt></rt>神社<rt>じんじゃ</rt></ruby> (for earning money to fix his house?).

<ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby> had aldready told to himself that he loved <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby>. There was no built-up parts for <ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> didn't think that she would fall in love. <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> looks kind of カッコイイ while doing that writing work.

<ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby> really lived at <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt>の<rt></rt>家<rt>いえ</rt></ruby>. <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> came to wake <ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby> up every morning.

<ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> looks like a grade schooler when she changes to her casual clothes.

Frontwing, the flowers frame does not look good at all. I think the Loca Love series were made by the "newcomers" team. I think that is a good thing for the employees.

<ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby> was working part-time at a cake store. <ruby>一太郎<rt>いちたろう</rt></ruby> brought some cake for <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> because he saw how her classmates treated <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> that day. <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby> lost her usual "aura?" during these times. <ruby>八千代<rt>やちよ</rt></ruby>'s strict father found the two were eating cakes. Uh, that sounded really terrible. It felt like your parents come into your room while you were having a great time with your partner.
