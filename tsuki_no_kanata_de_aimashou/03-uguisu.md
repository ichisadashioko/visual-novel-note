## うぐいす route

I still have no idea what 灯華 said means at the beginning of the game.

---

```
x 行くなと言う
  灯華の好きにさせる
```

灯華が綺麗だから。

---

I think if we choose the first option, that'll mean 奏汰 will end up with 聖衣良.

```
  俺のことを占ってもらう
x 別の人を占ってもらう
```

---

```
  新谷灯華
x 日紫喜うぐいす
  佐倉雨音
```

I think I will try to get into うぐいす route this time.

---

```
x なにか拭くものを···
  佐倉の肌って···
```

---

灯華 is the opposite of dense-type protagonist. She cares about every little romance related things.

```
x モールス信号を調べる
  光で文字を書いてみる
```

The second option is just too lame.

灯華 discovers the abandon military place at this moment.

---

I think we should let うぐいす know that 奏汰 sent モールス信号 but not with 灯華. Well, 奏汰 lies either ways but the second option doesn't make うぐいす get mad at 奏汰.

```
  灯華と一緒にやったと白状する
x うぐいす先輩にはバルたくない
```

Well, that's not an option and I do feel kind of guilty for doing that.

---

```
  夜遊びしていたと認める
x 聖衣良の教育上、否定する
```

ごめんね。聖衣良

```
  タオルをとりにいく
x これくらいすぐに乾くはず
```

ごめん雨音。何十年と一緒にのこと忘れないよ

> 雨音: ···ベーグル大佐

I just notice the cat mascot here the first time.

ちょっと待って。If 奏汰 is not going to hook up with 雨音 then 雨音's parents effort is kinda in vain, isn't it. Because they left 雨音 alone so that she can meet and fall in love with 奏汰.

---

奏汰は小説を書くのこと、うぐいす先輩めちゃくちゃ興味がある。

```
x 見かけによらず乙女だよな
  やっばりなんでもない
```

きた!

```
x 想いを書く (うぐいす)
  小説としての完成度を高める (灯華)
  まったく別の展開を考える - not choosable
  落ち着いて考え直す (雨音) - not choosable
```

I think that every heroines has 2 encounters that we need to choose the right option to unlock their routes here.

---

奏汰 was hurt and went around to find the school nurse. 奏汰 discovered that うぐいす also used some social network site on smartphone. She is kind of wanting to hide that fact.

---

奏汰 is still being caught by police but there is no dialog with the police this route. However, うぐいす sees 奏汰's bike and waits for him there.

```
x これではばっちりです
  はい、まちがってます
```

うぐいす is quite dense.

奏汰は金持ち? His motorbike from 雨音's route doesn't look cheap at all.

This doesn't look good at all. うぐいす in 灯華's route seems to more
...

There is no ring bell with うぐいす event.

灯華 seems to very caring and "knowledgeable".

This looks pretty bad. うぐいす will go oversea after graduating. This is getting akward.

---

Why うぐいす also has colar?

奏汰がカッコイイ

![](https://i.imgur.com/VyCot49.png)

うぐいす has [haemophilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia).

![](https://i.imgur.com/WEa19nQ.png)

That is a lot of CGs for a day.

うぐいすは大胆

うぐいす is getting annoying.

---

```
  日紫喜さん
  うぐいすさん
x うぐいす
```

I am not a fan of さん suffix.

奏汰 still refers うぐいす as "うぐいすさん"

---

Unlike with 灯華 and 雨音, 奏汰 and うぐいす have their first time at ホテル. I would love to have our first at our place.

---

うぐいす is not seeing 奏汰 for some reasons.

文化祭か

---

賢斗 and 円 are very supportive in this route.

ええ、うぐいす is not making sense at all.

---

奏汰 becomes novelist in this route. We have 6 years timeskip. BIBLIO CAFE is still being opened by 奏汰 and うぐいす. They help the owner to keep the cafe running.

---

I think 雨音 is the most developed character so far.

---

うぐいすの反応は可愛いですね

- 奏汰 discovers that うぐいす starts to write 小説
- うぐいす tries to not hear 奏汰's feedback

---

聖衣良 and <ruby>月ヶ洞<rt>つきがほら</rt>きらり</ruby> help 奏汰 and うぐいす manage the store so that they can go on a trip together.

After they came back, 聖衣良 and <ruby>月ヶ洞<rt>つきがほら</rt>きらり</ruby> interrogated 奏汰 about if he has proposed or not.

うぐいす collapsed at the store while 奏汰 was discussing about his work at the publishing company. 聖衣良 called 奏汰 and told him that.

うぐいすの母 told 奏汰 that うぐいす didn't take the medicine for her blood disease for a while and she is reaching her limit. The medicine that 奏汰 saw うぐいす take everyday is for her liver not for her blood disease.

> もう···長くはあり···ませ、ん···

奏汰 was shocked after hearing those word. His vision became blurry.

うぐいすの母 tells 奏汰 everything about うぐいす's condition.

---

奏汰 proposed to うぐいす.

![](https://i.imgur.com/aqiRv0i.png)

I think the definition of 普通 is blurry and twisted in うぐいす thinking.

---

うぐいす passed away in the day that she finished her 小説.

![](https://i.imgur.com/14hhTpS.png)

奏汰 remembered that うぐいす used to write 日記 on wixi.

---

Around a year later, 奏汰 discovers that the medicine that can cure うぐいす's disease. 奏汰 realized that if he had let go of うぐいす, she would be treated.

奏汰 is getting depressed and became 引きこもり.

聖衣良 often comes and checks on 奏汰 every now and then.

One day, きらり came and helped to snap 奏汰 out. 奏汰 came back from hell 🎉

---

奏汰 came to high school and picked up some of うぐいす's book. 奏汰 found the Endymion smartphone there. 賢斗 helps to boot up the phone and there is a photo of 奏汰 and うぐいす as the background screen. This phone was belonged to 灯華. I hope there will a more detail explanation about 灯華 as the game progress. 灯華 route doesn't have much information.

There is a video that 灯華 recorded. There is うぐいす in it.

賢斗 tells the story about sending message to oneself in the past.

奏汰 brough the phone home and send message to himself many times.

> 後悔するぞ

奏汰 continues spam himself many days later ... at many places.

Someone replies back. It is 奏汰 from high school time.

---

The story continues with 奏汰 "manipulating" his past self with consideration about him as a teenager. The story is told in a quick flashback liked fashion.

---

奏汰 makes うぐいす hate him in the past.

---

満月 is coming. Did 奏汰 change the history?

---

奏汰 works at the publishing company. It seems that this is a different timeline.

奏汰 has some memory of another timeline but he is not sure whose it from. He wrote 小説 named "月の彼方" and put it on the Web. I think it is about the memory of another timeline. 奏汰 comes to the bell place because that memory has a promise to meet someone/something there. うぐいす read the 小説 and also comes there too. The two of them haven't met for a long time in this timeline.

I not sure why did うぐいす leave 奏汰 in this timeline. How close did 奏汰 and うぐいす get in this timeline during high school?

うぐいす's disease has been treated. She just came back from another country. And 奏汰's tear is falling with knowing why.

二人はそこで一緒に満月を見て

That is the end of うぐいす route.

## Second playthrough

I realized that there are some missing CGs and the After Part is not unlocked for うぐいす先輩.

Rollback and not tease 灯華

Rollback and choose Morse code

```

```

I think we may get into うぐいす route with another perspective with this choice.

```
x 桃華と一緒にやったと白状する

```

```

```

Yes, I unlocked うぐいす route. Let's see where this choice will lead us.

```
x 想いを書く (うぐいす)
  小説としての完成度を高める (灯華)
  まったく別の展開を考える (聖衣良) - not choosable

```

副部長 speech is still calm so I think we should be in うぐいす route now.

副部長 asks うぐいす if there is any other reasons other than her disease that うぐいす does not go out with him. 副部長 suggests that うぐいす is interested in 奏汰. うぐいす didn't actually deny that but replied that 奏汰 is いい後輩. 灯華 and 奏汰 who were hiding in the storage room, intepreted it as that 奏汰 is not going to have much chance to go out with うぐいす.

灯華 invited 奏汰 to the beach for a change.

```
  これでぱっちりでせ！
x はい、間違ってます
```

文芸部 needs to buy new books. うぐいす asks 奏汰 to come with her. As otaku culture, 奏汰 just has a date with うぐいす even through うぐいす has just reject his confession a few days ago.

---

奏汰 brought うぐいす to the hospital (ミドリホスピタル).

> 先輩、慣れてたよな

That was how 奏汰 feels when seeing how the hospital staffs handled うぐいす case - everything went smoothly. 奏汰 was left alone and waiting for うぐいす. 奏汰 looked outside the window and realized that the sky has already become dark. It made 奏汰 feel that うぐいす will never come back.

> このままもうずっと先輩が戻って来ないような気がしてしまう

---

うぐいす tried a lot of methods from books that うぐいす read since the first day that うぐいす dated 奏汰. うぐいす came to 奏汰's classroom to pick 奏汰 up every single days in lunch time and after school. うぐいす also made lunch for 奏汰, came to 奏汰's house in the morning so that they can come to school together even though うぐいす's house doesn't seem close to 奏汰's house.

奏汰 felt very akward. A few days later, 奏汰 invited his friend - 円 and 賢斗 - over to ask for how to deal with the current akward situation as うぐいす didn't leave time for 奏汰 to hang out with his friends - 円 and 賢斗. 円 and 賢斗 held a court-like thing to judge 奏汰's guilt for flirting with his girlfriend every single days in front of them. That was the second time they have a court like that. The first time was on the second day うぐいす and 奏汰 date each others and うぐいす came to 奏汰's classroom and amazed 奏汰's classmate and the surrounding classes.

After having hear his friends' opinions, 奏汰 then had a talk with うぐいす as 奏汰 think they should not continue like this. 奏汰 asked うぐいす that if the 恋人らし things that うぐいす did recently was from all kind of books that うぐいす read. うぐいす admitted that as she didn't not know what to do as a couple, she tried those references from those books. 奏汰 told that as this was the first time for both of them, they can move at their own pace. There is not need to do things that they are not familiar with.

After that, 奏汰 and うぐいす continued with their date. They went to the game center and うぐいす played at claw machine for the first time.

---

I think if we choose the first option - call うぐいす by her last name even though she is trying to getting their relationship more intimate, うぐいす might consider keep up with her treatement instead of spending time with 奏汰. Yeah, I'm destroying their relationship for うぐいす's life.

```
x 日紫喜さん
  うぐいすさん
  うぐいす
```

奏汰 still ended up refer うぐいす as うぐいすさん. I'm not sure what's about the `うぐいすさん` option. And うぐいす still refered 奏汰 as 奏汰くん. However, I think that with this option, the dialog was a little different with the last playthrough with the `うぐいす` option.

---

It turned out that the problem with missing CGs was the program fault. I was still able to view all the CGs but the CG counter was not updated. I also cannot go straight into うぐいす's `After Part` as it is blurred out.
