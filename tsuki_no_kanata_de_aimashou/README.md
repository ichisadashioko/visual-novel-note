# 月の彼方で会いましょう

## 灯華 route

The protagonist's name is <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> which has similar sound as the game title (<ruby>彼方<rt>かなた</rt></ruby>).

The game starts with the main character as a adult. He recalls about his high school past. He also has some flashback about <ruby>灯華<rt>とうか</rt></ruby>'s speech and about she was pointing a pink gun at her hear. She was asking <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> if she comes to the other side of the moon, would he chase after her.

After the flashback, we arrive at <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby>'s high school time.

We had 2 choices before leaving our focus with 灯華. Probably rasing flag here.

---

The first heroine we will interact is <ruby>灯華<rt>とうか</rt></ruby>. She seems always come late to class and sleep in the class all the time.

Once, she was being chased by a teacher. She came to <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby>'s club room and asked him to hide her. Her speech during this encounter is very energetic. She gave me the impression of ギャル (gal) - a very beautiful person instead of a bitchy one. She read <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby>'s novel (note) which he hopelessly tried to get it back.

---

It seems that 奏汰 works for a cafe (<ruby>店<rt>みせ</rt></ruby>).The cafe seems to be operated by <ruby>聖衣良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby>'s family. She is quite childish (子供っぽい). Is she a middle schooler? She seems to be quite talent at drawing. Her <ruby>声優<rt>せいゆう</rt></ruby>'s voice is quite childish. She seems to be a <ruby>占<rt>うらな</rt>い</ruby> type of person.

After work, we had two choices:

```
  俺のことを占ってもらう
x 別の人を占ってもらう
```

I probably skip <ruby>聖衣良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby> with second option. Now we have 3 more choices:

```
x 新谷灯華
  日紫喜ひしきうぐいす
  佐倉雨音
```

Let's choose our main heroine 灯華.

聖依良 asks 奏汰 about 将来. He answers he had 部活動 and バイト so he didn't think much about it. <ruby>聖依良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby> wants to be a fashion designer.

> お兄ちゃんのお嫁さん

<ruby>聖依良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby> seems to be <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby>'s cousin. Her family does not operate the <ruby>店<rt>みせ</rt></ruby>.

> 彼女が欲しい！

---

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> met <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> on his moon stroll several days later.

> <ruby>満月<rt>まんげつ</rt>の<rt></rt>日<rt>ひ</rt>に、お<rt></rt>月<rt>つき</rt>さまがいっぱい<rt></rt>涙<rt>なみだ</rt>を<rt></rt>流<rt>なが</rt>して、<rt></rt>泣<rt>な</rt>きやんだあとに</ruby>

It started to rain.

She got wet. And we can see her <ruby>下着<rt>したぎ</rt></ruby>. With a cute reaction. We have to choose:

- <ruby>なにか<rt></rt>拭<rt>ふ</rt>くものを</ruby>
- <ruby>佐倉<rt>さくら</rt>の<rt></rt>肌<rt>はだ</rt>って</ruby>

Let's be a gentleman here. I went with the first choice.

```
x なにか拭くものを
  佐倉の肌って
```

> おまえは...誰だ

I can't hold my laugh. 🤣

> タナカ 🤣

> 子猫みたいな

---

> <ruby>勝手<rt>かって</rt>に<rt></rt>人<rt>ひと</rt>の<rt></rt>心<rt>こころ</rt>の<rt></rt>声<rt>こえ</rt>アテレコしないでくれるかな</ruby> 🤣

---

> 灯華とデートしたい！

> 好きビーム

灯華 wants to use LED at 灯台 (lighthouse) to celebrate うぐいす先輩. Moose code is kinda classic, isn't it? Yeah, most of us know about Moose code but don't actually know Moouse code itself at all. Let's see what else do we have here:

- <ruby>モールス<rt></rt>信号<rt>しんごう</rt>を<rt></rt>調<rt>しら</rt>べる</ruby>
- <ruby>光<rt>ひかり</rt>で<rt></rt>文字<rt>もじ</rt>を<rt></rt>書<rt>か</rt>いてむる</ruby>

I think research about Moose code is kinda pathetic. I will go with second choice.

No, the second choice is boring.

```
x モールス信号を調べる
  光で文字を書いてむる
```

灯華 is quite excited about Moose code.

奏汰 spent the night with 灯華 inside 灯台.

She is めちゃくちゃ眠い in the next morning.

They sent "Happy Birthday" in Moose code.

---

うぐいす先輩 seems to know Moouse code. Flag time:

```
x 灯華と一緒にやったと白状する
  うぐいす先輩にはパレたくない
```

I wonder if 灯華 is happy about we tell うぐいす先輩 about last night. Let's try.

先輩 seems not happy about it. Let's try the other choice.

Let's continue with our first choice.

---

We are also being interrogated by 妹さん - 聖衣良.

```
x 夜遊びしていたと認める
  聖衣良の教育上、否定する
```

Let's be an adult an admit that.

Adult is pretty unfair with children.

---

Our next encounter with 雨音 at the cafe in another rainy day.

```
x タオルをとりにいく
  これくらいすぐに乾くはず
```

---

I decide to force 奏汰 to complete the novel.

灯華 is kinda a push-over one.

I think we get into 灯華 route. She came over. Now, she is taking お風呂. She is also going to use 奏汰's パンツ.

I think we have Summer Pockets cross-over. 猫と冒険

灯華 does't like to read a lot of 漢字.

We are going to have a date with 灯華 to buy smartphone.

---

灯華 is going to transfer.

---

We missed 灯華の誕生日 (22日2月). She still has cake.

---

振られた。灯華で。

---

In the After part, we met with several heroines that didn't appear in the School Arc.

灯華 dissapeared behind the train. And we have 8 years time skip.

奏汰 found 灯華's smartphone. He uses this phone to send LIME message to himself.

He asked his past self to write something in the "猫の..." book. 灯華 wrote something.

> 私はここにいる
> ニャーニャーニャー

奏汰 still keeps in touch with うぐいす先輩.

> 猫っぽい子

---

It seems that there are suspicious photos in 灯華's smartphone. There is not any visual photo for us to look at. 奏汰 asked 佐倉雨音 to "decrypt" them. She suggested that he should not look into the data but still handed over for him anyway.

---

It seems that our trip with 灯華 to 京都 is going to be changed. We will find out where she was going alone. She had some killer photo in her smartphone.

Love hotel だ

してないかった

---

While high school 奏汰 is filrting with 灯華, adult 奏汰 will have a date with 岬栞菜.

---

I have finished 灯華 route.

灯華 wanted to kill her biological father "Kazama" だってか? We didn't know that person she wants to kill is her father. I thought that he kills her mother or made her mother commits suicide. Well, the truth is not far from that. But now we know that the person 灯華 wants to kill is her father.

In the highschool "timeline", 奏汰 and 灯華 do it nearly every occasion (even outside).

I put "timeline" in quote because there is a reason. Let's put it off here and tell more about it later.

Oh. I didn't mention before that 岬栞菜 (漫画家さん) made a 漫画 based on the story 奏汰 told her about his 初恋 with 灯華.

In highschool "timeline", 奏汰 and 灯華 kidnapped 灯華's father (with gun and car).

岬栞菜 tried to hit on 奏汰. Sorry, I realised that we already on 灯華 route so we cannot branch off here.

After the ending and conversation with 灯華, I think that 灯華 was the one who send message to 奏汰. There is no sending message through time here. 灯華 wanted to see if 奏汰 will love no matter she had an unfortunated life and may not bring him happiness. And the story about highschool "timeline" is created by 奏汰 and featured in the 漫画 as 奏汰 answer to 灯華.

Maybe 灯華 took an photo of 奏汰 in secret back in the days he was still working at the cafe. She may even intrude his apartment to put her writing in the "猫の..." book. And 奏汰, as a novelist, made a story from his experience.

One thing is still not clear for me about the flashback at the beginning when 灯華 points the gun at her head. I think may be 奏汰 did experience that flashback but the story about 奏汰 highschool before 8 years timeskip is from the 漫画. Maybe the real timeline is a mix of the highschool "timeline" and the "timeline" that we go through in 奏汰 highschool. However, the highschool "timeline" ending is created by 奏汰 as his resolution to 灯華.

## 雨音 route

In the start, I pay attention to the background music and we have some heart-beat like sound. It makes me remember about 灯華 near dying moment in the last route.

> <ruby>月<rt>つき</rt>が<rt></rt>冷<rt>つめ</rt>たく<rt></rt>冴<rt>さ</rt>えた<rt></rt>夜<rt>よる</rt>だった</ruby> - It was a night with clear sky and cold moon.

> <ruby>もし<rt></rt>私<rt>わたし</rt>がお<rt></rt>月<rt>つき</rt>様<rt>さま</rt>の<rt></rt>彼方<rt>かなた</rt>にいっちゃったら・・・<rt></rt>追<rt>お</rt>いかけてきてくる？なーんて・・・</ruby>

- I still not know much about what 灯華 want to say at the beginning. She asks 奏汰 to not forget about she was here, she was beside 奏汰.

---

We came back at the school scene.

> <ruby>いつも、<rt></rt>学校<rt>がっこう</rt>の<rt></rt>風<rt>ふう</rt>景<rt>けい</rt>。<rt></rt>何<rt>なに</rt>も<rt></rt>変<rt>か</rt>わることのない、<rt></rt>昨日<rt>きの</rt>と<rt></rt>同<rt>おな</rt>じ<rt></rt>光<rt>こう</rt>景<rt>けい</rt>。どこがで<rt></rt>見<rt>み</rt>たような、<rt></rt>繰<rt>く</rt>り<rt></rt>返<rt>かえ</rt>される<rt></rt>日<rt>にち</rt>常<rt>じょう</rt></ruby>

- He was talking about going to school everyday, seeing the same thing over and over again, nothing is changed.

> しかしーー

However,

That is when 灯華 came to class (of course late).

I do find it amusing when 灯華 came late to class but she also yawned. (・・・ふわぁ・・・)

灯華 has a lot of rumor because of she doesn't participate in any club, leave school right after it ends. 夜遊び, 体を売る, and クラスメイトをいじめて自殺する.

---

奏汰 and his buddies (<ruby>田<rt>た</rt>島<rt>じま</rt>賢<rt>けん</rt>斗<rt>と</rt></ruby> and <ruby>環<rt>たまき</rt>円<rt>まどか</rt></ruby>) were hanging out on the roof-top to talk about rumor related to 灯華.

Roof-top is a pretty common misconception thing. I remember that I came to my school roof-top twice. It was dirty. It is one of the worst place to hangout with others. It seems pretty dangerous when I come there alone because there were a lot of bad students in school. It was pretty scary when I think they would pick on me when I am alone.

---

奏汰 seems to reject the rumor about 灯華 because he had seen one other side of 灯華.

I do find it strange for 灯華 who doesn't talk much in class. On her encounter with 奏汰, she speaks a lot and to be very open to 奏汰.

> あ、えーと、<ruby>佐<rt>さ</rt>藤<rt>とう</rt></ruby>くん？

> そっかそっか、<ruby>田<rt>た</rt>中<rt>なか</rt></ruby>くんだ！

灯華 guessing 奏汰's name really brings me some smile. 🤭

Is guessing the other person's name in 漢字 really that easy?

Why most visual novels try to use uncommon 漢字 usage?

<ruby>文<rt>ぶん</rt>藝<rt>げい</rt>部<rt>ぶ</rt></ruby> instead of <ruby>文<rt>ぶん</rt>芸<rt>げい</rt>部<rt>ぶ</rt></ruby>

奏汰の創作 in highschool is <ruby>展<rt>てん</rt>望<rt>ぼう</rt>灯<rt>とう</rt>台<rt>だい</rt>の<rt></rt>少<rt>しょう</rt>女<rt>じょ</rt></ruby>

奏汰 was only plan to let 日紫喜うぐいす先輩 read that novel but 灯華 stole his note and she was reading it while forcing 奏汰 to buy her a drink.

> <ruby>祭<rt>まつ</rt>りの<rt></rt>夜<rt>よる</rt>、<rt></rt>展<rt>てん</rt>望<rt>ぼう</rt>灯<rt>とう</rt>台<rt>だい</rt>に<rt></rt>登<rt>のぼ</rt>る<rt></rt>少<rt>しょう</rt>女<rt>じょ</rt>。</ruby>

---

```
  行くなと言う
> 灯華の好きにさせる
```

I will try to not get into 灯華's route. 灯華 is the main heroine that makes the story center around her so I'm not sure if this choice will have any effect at all.

Oh, I notice a poster on the background while turning 灯華 down.

![school poster](https://i.imgur.com/tUnqSFv.png)

---

奏汰 seems to think about how 灯華 is doing out there and cannot concentrate on writing the novel.

<ruby>円</rt>まどか</rt></ruby> came outside to eat some うどん. And he was caught by some teachers. He lied that he was waiting for 奏汰 to pick him up.

---

After rescusing <ruby>円<rt>まどか</rt></ruby>, 奏汰 searchs around for 灯華.

灯華 comes into a hotel with a man seems to much older than her.

A little while later, I think 灯華 was preparing to jumping out of the window.

奏汰 calls out for her. 灯華 notices 奏汰 and falls.

---

Why 奏汰 doesn't clean 灯華's wound before apply the bandage. She would get an infection. 奏汰 may actually do clean 灯華's wound but the visual only show 奏汰 helping 灯華 apply ガーゼ.

---

During lunch break, 奏汰 was lurking around with his buddies and noticed <ruby>佐<rt>さ</rt>倉<rt>くら</rt>雨<rt>れ</rt>音<rt>いん</rt></ruby>. 奏汰 talked about he sit next to her and tried to talk to her but she didn't reply. I don't remember seeing <ruby>佐<rt>さ</rt>倉<rt>くら</rt>雨<rt>れ</rt>音<rt>いん</rt></ruby> in 奏汰's class. If it was a multiple classes lesson then it should be a all stand up class. For some reason, <ruby>佐<rt>さ</rt>倉<rt>くら</rt>雨<rt>れ</rt>音<rt>いん</rt></ruby> glares at 奏汰.

---

奏汰 works at ビブリオカフェ.

We first meet 聖衣良 here. 聖衣良 is a sixth grader. I think she is trying to order the drink which is listed on the counter (カウンター) where she can't reach with her height.

<ruby>聖衣良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby> draws something (<ruby>夏<rt>なつ</rt>回<rt>かい</rt>けの<rt></rt>服<rt>ふく</rt></ruby>) after ordering her blend coffee.

奏汰 will send 聖衣良 home because her mother is busy.

---

It was summer in the game. It is at the end of March at the time of writing this line. The weather is always annoying me whether it is summer or winter that is my current thought about weather.

聖衣良 is around 11. She is at the age as my 妹 now.

Oh, 聖衣良 is going to ask 奏汰 about who he wants to do 占い for.

Let's see the "<ruby>別<rt>べつ</rt>の<rt></rt>人<rt>ひと</rt>を<rt></rt>占<rt>うらな</rt>ってもらう</rt></ruby>" option has <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> or not. Yes, it does.

> <ruby>そう、<rt></rt>選<rt>せん</rt>択<rt>たく</rt>授<rt>じゅ</rt>業<rt>ぎょう</rt>の<rt></rt>情<rt>じょう</rt>報<rt>ほう</rt>Cで<rt></rt>隣<rt>となり</rt>の<rt></rt>席<rt>せき</rt>なんだ</ruby>

So 奏汰 was just at the same classroom with <ruby>雨<rt>れ</rt>音<rt>いん</rt></ruby> once in a while.

The dialog after this doesn't seem to change much with the last route with 灯華. <ruby>聖衣良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby> asks 奏汰 about <ruby>将<rt>しょう</rt>来<rt>らい</rt></ruby>.

---

A few days later, 奏汰 can't think of new ideas for his novel. It was still early at night so 奏汰 decided to go outside while picking up his bike's key.

I search for <ruby>江<rt>え</rt>ノ<rt>の</rt>島<rt>しま</rt></ruby> and it seems that the island also exists in real life.

> <ruby>佐倉<rt>さくら</rt>の<rt></rt>肌<rt>はだ</rt>って・・・</ruby>

---

I think ポール・クレイ refers to Steve Jobs. エンデュミオン is iPhone5 equivalent.

奏汰 is sleepy and <ruby>賢<rt>けん</rt>斗<rt>と</rt></ruby> is going to get him モンエレ. 灯華 steals it and runs away. 奏汰 chases after 灯華 to the third-year area. 灯華 asks 奏汰 to hangout with her in the weekend. 奏汰 plans to go 江ノ島 and 灯華 will tag along.

奏汰 and 灯華 stay at 灯台 till the next morning to give うぐいす先輩 some birthday present.

---

After うぐいす先輩's 誕生日, 奏汰 met <ruby>雨<rt>れ</rt>音<rt>いん</rt></ruby> at ビブリオカフェ. It also rains that day. Why <ruby>聖衣良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby> didn't remember <ruby>雨<rt>れ</rt>音<rt>いん</rt></ruby> when 奏汰 mentioned it before?

Some <ruby>中<rt>ちゅう</rt>二<rt>に</rt>病<rt>びょう</rt></ruby> jokes really does it job here.

> <ruby>あ、<rt></rt>封神<rt>アンチンウル</rt>剣聖<rt>ソートマスター</rt></ruby>

> えーダサいよ、超ダサい

---

> <ruby>想<rt>おも</rt>いを<rt></rt>書<rt>か</rt>く</ruby>

I'm not sure this choice will lead to <ruby>雨<rt>れ</rt>音<rt>いん</rt></ruby> route or not. It's more like うぐいす先輩 route. Let's continue a little bit longer.

灯華 still comes in the clubroom. I feel like 奏汰 develops feeling for 灯華 in highschool is part of the story.

奏汰 and 灯華 is going to hide in the clubroom. I'm not sure if choosing the option to not tell うぐいす先輩 about staying with 灯華 will change うぐいす先輩's answer about 奏汰.

<ruby>副<rt>ふく</rt>部<rt>ぶ</rt>長<rt>ちょう</rt></ruby> doesn't have a name. かわいそう.

It seems that うぐいす先輩 body is weak.

うぐいす先輩 does answer a little bit different. She doesn't deny or answer the question.

奏汰 still brings 灯華 home after she got wet trying to pick up the novel.

I will rollback with the last choice.

> <ruby>落<rt>お</rt>ち<rt></rt>着<rt>つ</rt>いて<rt></rt>考<rt>かんが</rt>え<rt></rt>直<rt>なお</rt>す</ruby>

---

奏汰 says that he hasn't sorted out his emotion for うぐいす先輩.

奏汰 remembers about his first <ruby>小<rt>しょう</rt>説<rt>せつ</rt></ruby> (novel) - <ruby>封神剣聖<rt>アンチンウルソートマスター</rt>Saga</ruby>. I think we are in <ruby>雨<rt>れ</rt>音<rt>いん</rt></ruby> route now.

奏汰 was about to find his first novel lying somewhere but he gave up because of not wanting to remember his <ruby>中<rt>ちゅう</rt>二<rt>に</rt>病<rt>びょう</rt></ruby> period.

---

奏汰 pulls out his smartphone to play game while thinking about how should he add the message to his <ruby>小<rt>しょう</rt>説<rt>せつ</rt></ruby>. The smartphone is about to run out of battery. 奏汰 annoys about he has to charge it twice a day.

奏汰 researches about <ruby>エンデュミオン<rt>Endymion</rt></ruby> which is the smartphone model <ruby>賢<rt>けん</rt>斗<rt>と</rt></ruby> was excited about lately.

奏汰 decides he will buy smartphone tomorrow. Now, 灯華's smartphone hasn't broken. 奏汰 will go buy smartphone alone.

---

It is raining.

> <ruby>雨<rt>あめ</rt>、か・・・</ruby>

<ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> meets 奏汰 on his way to buy smartphone. Most of our encounters with <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> is always during rain. <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt> name has the rain kanji (雨) in it.

There is only one <ruby>傘<rt>かさ</rt></ruby> (umbrella) but two people need to go home. You know what is going to happen next.

> <ruby>カナタの<rt></rt>右<rt>みぎ</rt>肩<rt>かた</rt>、<rt></rt>濡<rt>ぬ</rt>れてる</ruby>

---

The next school day, 奏汰 goes to the classroom full of computers and sees a half-eaten bread next to his seat. I am not where was 雨音 hiding. Was 雨音 under the table?

We are in 雨音 route now. I think I choose the <ruby>中<rt>ちゅう</rt>二<rt>に</rt>病<rt>びょう</rt></ruby> choice. I think 奏汰 will ask 雨音 about what she was doing anyway.

> ところで、さっきなにやってたんだ？

> <ruby>真闇<rt>やみ</rt>の・・・<rt></rt>炎<rt>ほのお</rt>・・・アビス・・・ヴォイド</ruby>

```
  ところで、さっきなにやってたんだ？
x 真闇やみの・・・炎ほのお・・・アビス・・・ヴォイド
```

> <ruby>こいつは、<rt></rt>遅<rt>おく</rt>れてきた<rt></rt>思春期<rt>ちゅうにびょう</rt>だ。</ruby>

That was the first same line for both choices. I will continue the route with the second choice.

---

It seems that <ruby>ビブリオ<rt>Biblio</rt>カフェ<rt>cafe</rt></ruby> is lacking women-power. 奏汰 will ask 灯華 and うぐいす先輩 for helping with the cafe.

Both 灯華 and うぐいす先輩 decline.

奏汰, his buddies and 雨音 have a group project. 雨音 seems not going to work with others.

---

This is the first time 灯華 meets 雨音.

雨音 and 灯華 both tease 奏汰 when seeing how 奏汰 acts around うぐいす先輩.

奏汰 has dragged 雨音 around "forcefully" lately for the group exercise for class. 雨音 seems not too mind 奏汰 at all for dragging her around. I feel like my common sense is too anti-social compare to how 奏汰 and 雨音 act here.

After done with shooting photos during lunch break, 雨音 is about to leave the group and having lunch alone as usual.

> <ruby>もう<rt></rt>一回<rt>いっかい</rt>、<rt></rt>佐倉<rt>さくら</rt>を<rt></rt>誘<rt>さそ</rt>ってみよう</ruby>

```
  そうするか
x もう一回、佐倉を誘ってみよう
```

---

雨音 will be always in the computer classroom in lunch break.

雨音 bites her lip while eating. 雨音 will leave to rinse her wound.

```
  チェンジしよ
x やめておこう
```

The first choice is kinda boring.

---

雨音 comes to <ruby>ビブリオカフェ<rt>Biblio cafe</rt></ruby> at night to return <ruby>傘<rt>かさ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>タオル<rt>towel</rt>.

> <ruby>これで、<rt></rt>明日<rt>あした</rt>からワタシとおまえは<rt></rt>敵<rt>てき</rt>同<rt>どう</rt>士<rt>し</rt>だ</ruby>

奏汰 made coffe for 雨音. I think this will be one of those memories every couples will recall after their marriages.

奏汰 also got 雨音's LIME ID.

---

While 奏汰 and his buddies stuggle are struggling to make the website as their group exercise, 雨音 is just eating. And when they are about to give up, 雨音 comes to rescue with her amazing keyboard skill which I have dreamed of for years.

> <ruby>邪<rt>じゃ</rt>眼<rt>がん</rt>ってなんだ？</ruby>

> <ruby>よろしく<rt></rt>頼<rt>たの</rt>む</ruby>

```
x 邪眼ってなんだ？
  よろしく頼む
```

雨音 is really excited about <ruby>中<rt>ちゅう</rt>二<rt>に</rt>病<rt>びょう</rt></ruby> stuff.

---

The teacher seems to provoke 奏汰's group and 雨音 injects virus via USB to the teacher's computer. I think it is a kind of a screen locker. The teacher requires all students to show their stuff and 奏汰 takes the USB from 雨音's hand and gets caught for having USB.

<ruby>山<rt>やま</rt>口<rt>ぐち</rt>先<rt>せん</rt>生<rt>せい</rt></ruby>, a famous sensei you can find at every school.

---

雨音's mother passed away when she was in 小学校. Grandma passed aways during 中学校. She has been living alone since then. I want to live alone too.

雨音 agrees to help 奏汰 at <ruby>ビブリオカフェ<rt>Biblio cafe</rt></ruby>. I see this coming (*** after work at workplace).

<ruby>藤<rt>ふじ</rt>沢<rt>さわ</rt>学園<rt>がくえん</rt></ruby> is the name of the school. I catch that during the interview of 雨音.

---

雨音 is about to skip her first day at work. Because of that, 奏汰 comes to her house.

I am sure how does 雨音's house look like. However, her room has sliding door, 9 monitors PC setup (my dream), many types of smartphone/tablet (Ahh, I want to become fiction character).

雨音 only has another outfit outside of school outfit in this game. I would prefer 雨音 to not wear that collar and occasionally pull off the hoodie's hat.

雨音 is using her drone to deliver the drink. I see the authors really want to try out many unreasonable dreams here.

雨音 is surprisingly "lazy" compare to her 8 years later in 灯華 route.

---

The illustration of 雨音 looks very cute but I feel really annoying at how her <ruby>声<rt>せい</rt>優<rt>ゆう</rt></ruby> tries to fake eating sound. It sounds even more unrealistic.

奏汰は雨音をいじめすぎ

雨音 has improved quite a lot at working. I do feel like it is kind of rush.

<ruby>賢斗<rt>けんと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>円<rt>まどか</rt></ruby> order something that I feel like the story back in track.

> <ruby>美味<rt>おい</rt>しくなあれ</ruby>

> もえもえきゅん

> <ruby>もう<rt></rt>少<rt>すこ</rt>し<rt></rt>様子<rt>ようす</rt>を<rt></rt>見<rt>み</rt>てみよう</ruby>

> <ruby>そろそろ<rt></rt>止<rt>と</rt>めに<rt></rt>入<rt>はい</rt>ろう</ruby>

```
  もう少し様子を見てみよう
x そろそろ止めに入ろう
```

---

> <ruby>やっぱり、<rt>教室<rt>きょうしつ</rt>まで<rt></rt>迎<rt>むか</rt>えに<rt></rt>行<rt>い</rt>こうかな？</ruby>

> <ruby>断固<rt>だんこ</rt>、いつものところで<rt></rt>待<rt>ま</rt>ち<rt></rt>合<rt>あ</rt>わせで</ruby>

```
x やっぱり、教室まで迎えに行こうかな？
  断固、いつものところで待ち合わせで
```

---

> しつこい

That line makes me remember しろは from Summer Pockets.

> Steal

There is a reference to <ruby>和真<rt>かずま</rt></ruby> in このすば.

雨音 makes a fortune by making smartphone games.

奏汰 was feeding 雨音 while she was playing game.

Even though, 奏汰 thinks that 雨音 is <ruby>ダメ<rt></rt>人間<rt>にんげん</rt></ruby>, 雨音 will be fine as shown in 灯華 route. I had the same feeling when I finished Summer Pockets. Everyone will be fine even if we don't do anything to help them. Do we make ourselves more grand that we actually are?

雨音 has a [GameCube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube) and a [Virtual Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Boy) in her room.

雨音 is kind of give in with 奏汰's rapid and forceful attacks.

雨音 will meet 奏汰's parents for the first time.

```
  俺も好きだ
x また早いんじゃないかな？
```

The second option is lame and pathetic but it may actually be what people say in real life.

I think 雨音 got us here. It was not <ruby>告<rt>こく</rt>白<rt>はく</rt></ruby>.

雨音 found <ruby>封神剣聖<rt>アンチンウルソートマスター</rt>Saga</ruby>.

> TUEEE - 強くて

奏汰 wants 雨音 to make friend with others. 雨音 doesn't seem to care for a very realistic reason (most people who will be asked to change will not care). 奏汰 asks her to try it out. 雨音 can easily act friendly with everyone else. 雨音 sometimes makes ドヤ顔 with 奏汰 while showing him how good she is at socializing with others.

雨音's mask is kind of breaking when 雨音のクラスメイトB talks about ゲーム. 😅

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> started to play game with <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> and the story shows us some of the common bait in P2W trick in game (e.g. "Starter pack" 4800円 (worth 12800円)).

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> spends summer time to play game with <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> at her house. <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> asks <ruby>奏汰<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> to give her a ring item in-game.

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> realizes that he and <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> spend all the time to play game in the summer. <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> invites <ruby>雨音</rt>れいん</rt></ruby> to watch firework (<ruby>花火<rt>はなび</rt></ruby>) at the end of summer. However, <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> didn't come.

<ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> and <ruby>灯華<rt>とうか</rt></ruby> both hate their fathers and have some kind of revenge plan. In <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> case, her father has already passed away.

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> always helps with criminal activities of heroines.

---

About <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby>'s criminal plan, they failed. <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby>'s father predicted her plan before. It's like <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby>'s parents did plan to leave <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> alone.

After having been caught, <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> received a message from her father in a smartphone. The cat AI is deleted by her father as her mother's <ruby>願<rt>ねが</rt>い</ruby>.

<ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> name means `rainbow`.

I feel that <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby>'s mother is the bad one here - "forces" <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby>'s father to complete their dream.

I think <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> mother's name is アイナ.

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> have quite an active sexual relationship since high school. They went to the same college but not the same department. <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> did write some novels till his forth year at college and then started to prepare for becoming a <ruby>会社員<rt>かいしゃいん</rt></ruby> but not as a writer.

I think that <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> stays naked while going around in her house quite often. <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> probably イチャイチャ quite a lot at <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby>'s place.

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt> moved out and live together in <ruby>東京<rt>とうきょう</rt> for both their study and work.

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> is about to write a story about the smartphone Endymion.

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> try to ask people for information about Endymion.

There are many people were able to send message back in time with the smartphone Endymion.

There is one boy whose father died from fire at workplace and left his mother, and his two sisters. The boy used the smartphone to send a message to his passed away father and he did reply back. The boy did tell his father about his death. His father did apologize for leaving the family. His father did tell the boy that even he knew there will be a fire (told by the boy from the future), he would rescue some people on that day.

<ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> researches quite a lot of things.

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> flys to the U.S. to research about Endymion. It has been 10 years since <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> has met <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby>. It was hint from the conversation of <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> with ダーナー.

I am not clear about what happned with the Endymion smartphone and ポール·グレイ's reputation. It seems that the Endymion smartphone was released to help the company (シトロン社 - Citron? Why can they just keep the English word representation? I feel really annoying when I come across these words.) without ポール·グレイ permission (he is death at that time).

What?

<ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> decided to help her mother. And we are currently at another timeline where <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby>'s mother is still alive.

This is the end of 雨音 route. It gave us a lot of information about the fiction side of this novel. About 雨音, I am not fond of her at the beginning of the game. As the story progress till her adulthood, she became a very lovable character. I like 雨音's clinginess, sweetness. 雨音 route made me laugh with jokes a lot from slice of life aspect during 奏汰 and 雨音 daily events.

## うぐいす route

I still have no idea what 灯華 said means at the beginning of the game.

---

```
x 行くなと言う
  灯華の好きにさせる
```

灯華が綺麗だから。

---

I think if we choose the first option, that'll mean 奏汰 will end up with 聖衣良.

```
  俺のことを占ってもらう
x 別の人を占ってもらう
```

---

```
  新谷灯華
x 日紫喜うぐいす
  佐倉雨音
```

I think I will try to get into うぐいす route this time.

---

```
x なにか拭くものを···
  佐倉の肌って···
```

---

灯華 is the opposite of dense-type protagonist. She cares about every little romance related things.

```
x モールス信号を調べる
  光で文字を書いてみる
```

The second option is just too lame.

灯華 discovers the abandon military place at this moment.

---

I think we should let うぐいす know that 奏汰 sent モールス信号 but not with 灯華. Well, 奏汰 lies either ways but the second option doesn't make うぐいす get mad at 奏汰.

```
  灯華と一緒にやったと白状する
x うぐいす先輩にはバルたくない
```

Well, that's not an option and I do feel kind of guilty for doing that.

---

```
  夜遊びしていたと認める
x 聖衣良の教育上、否定する
```

ごめんね。聖衣良

![](https://i.imgur.com/J0laY9c.png)

```
  タオルをとりにいく
x これくらいすぐに乾くはず
```

ごめん雨音。何十年と一緒にのこと忘れないよ

> 雨音: ···ベーグル大佐

I just notice the cat mascot here the first time.

ちょっと待って。If 奏汰 is not going to hook up with 雨音 then 雨音's parents effort is kinda in vain, isn't it. Because they left 雨音 alone so that she can meet and fall in love with 奏汰.

---

奏汰は小説を書くのこと、うぐいす先輩めちゃくちゃ興味がある。

```
x 見かけによらず乙女だよな
  やっばりなんでもない
```

きた!

```
x 想いを書く (うぐいす)
  小説としての完成度を高める (灯華)
  まったく別の展開を考える - not choosable
  落ち着いて考え直す (雨音) - not choosable
```

I think that every heroines has 2 encounters that we need to choose the right option to unlock their routes here.

![](https://i.imgur.com/nvD2eS3.png)

---

奏汰 was hurt and went around to find the school nurse. 奏汰 discovered that うぐいす also used some social network site on smartphone. She is kind of wanting to hide that fact.

---

奏汰 is still being caught by police but there is no dialog with the police this route. However, うぐいす sees 奏汰's bike and waits for him there.

```
x これではばっちりです
  はい、まちがってます
```

うぐいす is quite dense.

奏汰は金持ち? His motorbike from 雨音's route doesn't look cheap at all.

This doesn't look good at all. うぐいす in 灯華's route seems to more
...

There is no ring bell with うぐいす event.

灯華 seems to very caring and "knowledgeable".

This looks pretty bad. うぐいす will go oversea after graduating. This is getting akward.

---

Why うぐいす also has colar?

![](https://i.imgur.com/QXm4qQc.png)

奏汰がカッコイイ

![](https://i.imgur.com/VyCot49.png)

うぐいす has [haemophilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia).

![](https://i.imgur.com/WEa19nQ.png)

That is a lot of CGs for a day.

うぐいすは大胆

うぐいす is getting annoying.

---

```
  日紫喜さん
  うぐいすさん
x うぐいす
```

I am not a fan of さん suffix.

奏汰 still refers うぐいす as "うぐいすさん"

---

Unlike with 灯華 and 雨音, 奏汰 and うぐいす have their first time at ホテル. I would love to have our first at our place.

---

うぐいす is not seeing 奏汰 for some reasons.

文化祭か

---

賢斗 and 円 are very supportive in this route.

ええ、うぐいす is not making sense at all.

---

奏汰 becomes novelist in this route. We have 6 years timeskip. BIBLIO CAFE is still being opened by 奏汰 and うぐいす. They help the owner to keep the cafe running.

---

I think 雨音 is the most developed character so far.

---

うぐいすの反応は可愛いですね

- 奏汰 discovers that うぐいす starts to write 小説
- うぐいす tries to not hear 奏汰's feedback

---

聖衣良 and <ruby>月ヶ洞<rt>つきがほら</rt>きらり</ruby> help 奏汰 and うぐいす manage the store so that they can go on a trip together.

After they came back, 聖衣良 and <ruby>月ヶ洞<rt>つきがほら</rt>きらり</ruby> interrogated 奏汰 about if he has proposed or not.

うぐいす collapsed at the store while 奏汰 was discussing about his work at the publishing company. 聖衣良 called 奏汰 and told him that.

うぐいすの母 told 奏汰 that うぐいす didn't take the medicine for her blood disease for a while and she is reaching her limit. The medicine that 奏汰 saw うぐいす take everyday is for her liver not for her blood disease.

> もう···長くはあり···ませ、ん···

奏汰 was shocked after hearing those word. His vision became blurry.

うぐいすの母 tells 奏汰 everything about うぐいす's condition.

---

奏汰 proposed to うぐいす.

![](https://i.imgur.com/aqiRv0i.png)

I think the definition of 普通 is blurry and twisted in うぐいす thinking.

---

うぐいす passed away in the day that she finished her 小説.

![](https://i.imgur.com/14hhTpS.png)

奏汰 remembered that うぐいす used to write 日記 on wixi.

---

Around a year later, 奏汰 discovers that the medicine that can cure うぐいす's disease. 奏汰 realized that if he had let go of うぐいす, she would be treated.

奏汰 is getting depressed and became 引きこもり.

聖衣良 often comes and checks on 奏汰 every now and then.

One day, きらり came and helped to snap 奏汰 out. 奏汰 came back from hell 🎉

---

奏汰 came to high school and picked up some of うぐいす's book. 奏汰 found the Endymion smartphone there. 賢斗 helps to boot up the phone and there is a photo of 奏汰 and うぐいす as the background screen. This phone was belonged to 灯華. I hope there will a more detail explanation about 灯華 as the game progress. 灯華 route doesn't have much information.

There is a video that 灯華 recorded. There is うぐいす in it.

賢斗 tells the story about sending message to oneself in the past.

奏汰 brough the phone home and send message to himself many times.

> 後悔するぞ

奏汰 continues spam himself many days later ... at many places.

Someone replies back. It is 奏汰 from high school time.

---

The story continues with 奏汰 "manipulating" his past self with consideration about him as a teenager. The story is told in a quick flashback liked fashion.

---

奏汰 makes うぐいす hate him in the past.

---

満月 is coming. Did 奏汰 change the history?

---

奏汰 works at the publishing company. It seems that this is a different timeline.

奏汰 has some memory of another timeline but he is not sure whose it from. He wrote 小説 named "月の彼方" and put it on the Web. I think it is about the memory of another timeline. 奏汰 comes to the bell place because that memory has a promise to meet someone/something there. うぐいす read the 小説 and also comes there too. The two of them haven't met for a long time in this timeline.

I not sure why did うぐいす leave 奏汰 in this timeline. How close did 奏汰 and うぐいす get in this timeline during high school?

うぐいす's disease has been treated. She just came back from another country. And 奏汰's tear is falling with knowing why.

二人はそこで一緒に満月を見て

That is the end of うぐいす route.

## Forth playthrough

```

灯華 suggests 奏汰 to confess to うぐいす先輩 using the 小説.

```

x やっばりなんでもない
```

奏汰 chooses what to do with the 小説.

```
  想いを書く (うぐいす) - not choosable
  小説としての完成度を高める (灯華)
  まったく別の展開を考える - not choosable
  落ち着いて考え直す (雨音) - not choosable

This is getting harder!

So honesty is not rewarded with 聖衣良.

奏汰 is having conversation about what to write for <ruby>進路<rt>しんろ</rt>希望<rt>きぼう</rt>調査<rt>ちょうさ</ruby>. It is the thing that 二年生たち have to do. It is relevant to what 聖衣良 wanted to talk about with 奏汰 before. I didn't remember if other routes also mentioned about this or not.

is what 奏汰 thought while he was in the clubroom after school.
