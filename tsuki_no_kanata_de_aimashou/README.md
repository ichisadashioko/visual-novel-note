# 月の彼方で会いましょう

The game is made with SiglusEngine. Because of that, I cannot play with LocalEmulator. I had to switch Windows's local and time zone in order to make the game to run.

The protagonist's name is <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> which has similar sound as the game title (<ruby>彼方<rt>かなた</rt></ruby>).

The game starts with the main character as a adult. He recalls about his high school past. He also has some flashback about <ruby>灯華<rt>とうか</rt></ruby>'s speech and about she was pointing a pink gun at her hear. She was asking <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> if she became the moon, would he chase after her.

After the flashback, we arrive at <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby>'s high school time.

We had 2 choices before leaving our focus with 灯華. Probably rasing flag here.

---

The first heroin we will interact is <ruby>灯華<rt>とうか</rt></ruby>. She seems always come late to class and sleep in the class all the time.

One time, she was being chased by a teacher. She came to <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby>'s club room and asked him to hide her. Her speech during this encounter is very energetic. She gave me the impression of ギャル (gal) - a very beautiful person instead of a bitchy one. She read <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby>'s novel (note) which he hopelessly tried to get it back.

---

It seems that 奏汰 works for a cafe (<ruby>店<rt>みせ</rt></ruby>).The cafe seems to be operated by <ruby>聖衣良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby>'s family. She is quite childish (子供っぽい). Is she a middle schooler? She seems to be quite talent at drawing. Her <ruby>声優<rt>せいゆう</rt></ruby>'s voice is quite childish. She seems to be a <ruby>占<rt>うらな</rt>い</ruby> type of person.

After work, we had two choices:

- 俺のことを占ってもらう
- 別の人を占ってもらう

I probably skip <ruby>聖衣良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby> with second option. Now we have 3 more choices:

- <ruby>新谷<rt>あらや</rt>灯華<rt>とうか</rt></ruby>
- <ruby>日紫喜<rt>ひしき</rt>うぐいす</ruby>
- <ruby>佐倉<rt>さくら</rt>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby>

Let's choose our main heroin 灯華.

聖依良 asks 奏汰 about 将来. He answers he had 部活動 and バイト so he didn't think much about it. <ruby>聖依良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby> wants to be a fashion designer.

> お兄ちゃんのお嫁さん

<ruby>聖依良<rt>せいら</rt></ruby> seems to be <ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby>'s cousin. Her family does not operate the <ruby>店<rt>みせ</rt></ruby>.

> 彼女が欲しい！

---

<ruby>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> met <ruby>雨音<rt>れいん</rt></ruby> on his moon stroll several days later.

> <ruby>満月<rt>まんげつ</rt>の<rt></rt>日<rt>ひ</rt>に、お<rt></rt>月<rt>つき</rt>さまがいっぱい<rt></rt>涙<rt>なみだ</rt>を<rt></rt>流<rt>なが</rt>して、<rt></rt>泣<rt>な</rt>きやんだあとに

It started to rain.

She got wet. And we can see her <ruby>下着<rt>したぎ</rt></ruby>. With a cute reaction. We have to choose:

- <ruby>なにか<rt></rt>拭<rt>ふ</rt>くものを</ruby>
- <ruby>佐倉<rt>さくら</rt>の<rt></rt>肌<rt>はだ</rt>って</ruby>

Let's be a gentleman here. I went with the first choice.

> おまえは...誰だ

I can't hold my laugh. 🤣

> タナカ 🤣

> 子猫みたいな

---

> <ruby>勝手<rt>かって</rt>に<rt></rt>人<rt>ひと</rt>の<rt></rt>心<rt>こころ</rt>の<rt></rt>声<rt>こえ</rt>アテレコしないでくれるかな</ruby> 🤣

---

> 灯華とデートしたい！

> 好きビーム

灯華 wants to use LED at 灯台 (lighthouse) to celebrate うぐいす先輩. Moose code is kinda classic, isn't it? Yeah, most of us know about Moose code but don't actually know Moouse code itself at all. Let's see what else do we have here:

- <ruby>モールス<rt></rt>信号<rt>しんごう</rt>を<rt></rt>調<rt>しら</rt>べる</ruby>
- <ruby>光<rt>ひかり</rt>で<rt></rt>文字<rt>もじ</rt>を<rt></rt>書<rt>か</rt>いてむる</ruby>

I think research about Moose code is kinda pathetic. I will go with second choice.

No, the second choice is boring.

灯華 is quite excited about Moose code.

奏汰 spent the night with 灯華 inside 灯台.

She is めちゃくちゃ眠い in the next morning.

They sent "Happy Birthday" in Moose code.

うぐいす先輩 seems to know Moouse code. Flag time:

- 灯華と一緒にやったと白状する
- うぐいす先輩にはパレたくない

I wonder if 灯華 is happy about we tell うぐいす先輩 about last night. Let's try.

先輩 seems not happy about it. Let's try the other choice.

Let's continue with our first choice.

---

We are also being interogated by 妹さん - 聖衣良.

- 夜遊びしていたと認める
- 聖衣良の教育上、否定する

Let's be an adult an admit that.

Adult is pretty unfair with children.

---

Our next encounter with 雨音 at the cafe in another rainy day.

- タオルをとりにいく
- これくらいすぐに乾くはず

--

I decide to force 奏汰 to complete the novel.

灯華 is kinda a push-over one.

I think we get into 灯華 route. She came over. Now, she is taking お風呂. She is also going to use 奏汰's パンツ.

I think we have Summer Pockets cross-over. 猫と冒険

And 灯華 is bad with 漢字.

We are going to have a date with 灯華 to buy smartphone.
