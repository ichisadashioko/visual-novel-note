I will just start to play from the `After Part` option this time.

As きらり is a bitch, I will not choose to mess with. It is kind bad for my heart.

```
  月ヶ洞きらり
x 日ノ本富士子
```

```
  自分の夢を語る
x いまは目の前の仕事に集中している

The first option will lead to 灯華 route and it is blurred out.

```
  試してみる
x 止めておく

奏汰 was having trouble to contact with <ruby>月ヶ洞<rt>つきがほら</rt>きらり</rt></ruby> in order to ask her to write a section for the company magazine. Her manager didn't let 奏汰 contact her. Luckily, <ruby>松宮<rt>まつみや</rt>霧子<rt>きりこ</rt></ruby> helped 奏汰 schedule a meeting with <ruby>月ヶ洞<rt>つきがほら</rt>きらり</rt></ruby> as they know each others.

<ruby>黒野<rt>くろの</rt>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> was able to persuade <ruby>月ヶ洞<rt>つきがほら</rt>きらり</rt></ruby> to write for the magazine and avoid her seduction.

In the following meeting, <ruby>松宮<rt>まつみや</rt>霧子<rt>きりこ</rt></ruby> was amazed about the fact that <ruby>黒野<rt>くろの</rt>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> was able to persuade <ruby>月ヶ洞<rt>つきがほら</rt>きらり</rt></ruby> to accept his work request. <ruby>松宮<rt>まつみや</rt>霧子<rt>きりこ</rt></ruby> - the manga department manager? - then asked 奏汰 about whether he is interested in doing some work at the manga department.

> I think if we choose the first option, we will get to work with <ruby>松宮<rt>まつみや</rt>霧子<rt>きりこ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>岬<rt>みさき</rt>栞菜<rt>かんな</rt></ruby> and fall in love with them. As I said before, I am not really comfortable with <ruby>月ヶ洞<rt>つきがほら</rt>きらり</rt></ruby> background and the second option looks like her flag.

In the following day(s), <ruby>松宮<rt>まつみや</rt>霧子<rt>きりこ</rt></ruby> brought <ruby>黒野<rt>くろの</rt>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> to the manga department. <ruby>黒野<rt>くろの</rt>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> was about to work with <ruby>岬<rt>みさき</rt>栞菜<rt>かんな</rt></ruby> as her editor. <ruby>黒野<rt>くろの</rt>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> spent time at the manga department to read some of <ruby>岬<rt>みさき</rt>栞菜<rt>かんな</rt></ruby>'s previous works. He gave some criticism to <ruby>松宮<rt>まつみや</rt>霧子<rt>きりこ</rt></ruby> as she asked him to. After that, <ruby>黒野<rt>くろの</rt>奏汰<rt>かなた</rt></ruby> brought a bunch of <ruby>岬<rt>みさき</rt>栞菜<rt>かんな</rt></ruby>'s works to home to try to know more about her.
