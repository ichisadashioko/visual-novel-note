<ruby>幸樹<rt>こうき</rt></ruby> and 生徒会たち are helping with the school festival (文化祭).

生徒会たち went with maid cafe.

After かおるこ had gave a talk to start the first day of 文化祭, 幸樹 waited for other female members to change to maid cosplay.

<ruby>未尋<rt>みひろ</rt></ruby> asked 幸樹's opinion about who is the most beautiful in maid cosplay.

> 先輩的には誰が一番似合ってると思います？

```
  みんな可愛いよ
x ······強いて言うなら兎亜かな
```

I thought we would get 4 choices here for each routes but it seems that is is not the case here. I will go with 兎亜 choice because of the 兎亜's sleep talk event recently.

かおるこ mentioned that her home only has helpers but doesn't have actual maids and 兎亜 also has a person that does laundry and cooking (幸樹). 未尋 said that she also want that person (幸樹). And 兎亜 said that she made an app for people to rent her お兄ちゃん (幸樹) for 100 円 per day (1日１００円).

> 未尋: ちょっと高いなぁ～
> 兎亜: う～ん、お友達価格で５０円でどう？

幸樹 is being sold for cheap 🤣.

> 未尋: 10円なら？

🤣🤣🤣

アーシェ called 幸樹 to do his job because he had been chatting with his buddies since he brought the pancake out for them.

```
x 調理場を手伝う
  フロアを手伝う
```

未尋 always makes dirty jokes during conversations and that made me want to have more encounters with her.

未尋 made some diry jokes but 幸樹 didn't take the job and ended up not doing anything together with 未尋 in the kitchen.

幸樹 was trying to get 兎亜 to go out and try to do things other than playing game during 文化祭. It seemed that サル's club made game center and there were many arcade games there. There was one arcade game that no one (at the 文化祭) has cleared yet. 兎亜 asked 幸樹 to play with her to show off "Pro Gamers" skills. 兎亜 decided to sit on top of 幸樹 to play the game. 兎亜 losed a few times. It seemed that game is pretty hard. 兎亜 and 幸樹 cleared the game. Nope, it was just STAGE 1.

兎亜 wants to be togother with 幸樹 as long as possible. 兎亜 told that she and 幸樹 are kind of indoor-な兄妹.

兎亜 has a lot of scene time lately so I think I am in 兎亜 route now.

鳴海兄妹 seem to have some unusual family situations. 兎亜 thought told something about that while 幸樹 was sending the other 生徒会 members home.
