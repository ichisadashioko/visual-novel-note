The game started with the protagonist's dream.

The protagonist just woke up in the morning and found himself surrounded by 5 美少女. He didn't know most of them expect for <ruby>光<rt>ひかり</rt></ruby>. They all expressed their love for him by speech and actions.

---

The protagonist is not just here to play king and flirt around. He has a very important quest for this country/world. That quest is to use his life-span to create "enery stone". And if he need to have sex with girls to regain his health in order to create more "energy stone".

We have two princesses from another countries that are here to help him. One of them is ソフィーヤ. ソフィーヤ seems to be a kind and gentle person. The other princess is シャルローネ. シャルローネ appears to not very interested in the protagonist romantically since they first met.

# 01A - <ruby>姫<rt>ひめ</rt>さまの<rt></rt>憂鬱<rt>ゆううつ</rt></ruby>

The protagonist was ordered (by マルー) to do some "練習" with the girls.

We had an enjoyable date with シャルローネ earlier this afternoon. I will we should do some "練習" with シャルローネ first.

I mistaked ソフィーヤ with シャルローネ. Well, let's keep going.

> エロ下着

We only hugged and slept with シャルローネ.

---

In the middle of the night, ソフィーヤ came to the protagonist's room. ソフィーヤ asked 陛下 to call her ソフィー and promised to go on a date together the following day as they wanted to know more about each others.

# 01B - 姫さまの初恋

The protagonist woke up and couldn't move his own body. And he need someone to kiss him in heal him temporarily. 光 revealed that 陛下's first kiss was taken (probably by 光) a long time ago and he didn't remember it.

As they were figuring out who should be the one to kiss 陛下, シャルローネ appeared and kissed him.

ソフィーヤ wanted to kiss 陛下 but refained from it.

---

After "producing" around 20 "energy stone", 陛下 was at his limit. ソフィーヤ took the chance and kissed 陛下. シャルローネ followed up with some more aggressive kisses.

ソフィーヤ was getting more depressed by the aggressiveness of シャルローネ. 陛下 and ソフィーヤ went on a date as they promised the day before. They went around the market and picked up some cooked fishes.

陛下 asked about why ソフィーヤ was so easily depressed about many little things. ソフィーヤ opened and talked about her background. ソフィーヤ read many love stories and she loved them. However, ソフィーヤ didn't have any love experience.

I think `hooksoft` had done a great job to create a princess character without no love experience. It is not as simple as here is the princess and she has no previous love experience.

---

There was someone from ソフィーヤ's country come to bring her back to her country. Luckily, he is just here to confirm that ソフィーヤ is happy or not.

Later at that night, ソフィーヤ came to 陛下's room (in her underwear only) to confess her love to him and offered herself to 陛下. 陛下 resolved to give his 童貞 to ソフィーヤ. They then came to ソフィーヤ's room and had a great night together. ソフィーヤ tried out something that she had learn from some weird books.

While ソフィーヤ was sleeping, 陛下 went outside and reminded about things when he came to this world. It seems that 平野 didn't have any memory before 8 year old. That is even before he came to this world. His mother is a foster parent.

# 02A - キキのご主人様

ソフィーヤ came to greet 陛下 early in the morning and she looked very happy. I wonder why シャルローネ didn't come.

As everyone was having breakfast, ソフィーヤ actions releaved to everyone that they have done it the day before. マルー was pleased with that and ordered to continue with シャルローネ. シャルローネ was also up for that.

> シャルローネ: 陛下？　私はいつでもOKよ

I think 陛下 "produced" up 1000 times more "energy stones" than the day before. After they were done with "producing energy stones", everyone decided to go back to the castle.

陛下 went around the castle to find キキ for some reasons. 陛下 found キキ and シャルローネ was together. The three of them then went shopping.

陛下 made ラーメン for everyone and they loved it. It was because キキ introduced all kind of weird wild grass that she ate before.

陛下 got キキ to talk about her dream. It seems that キキ loves books. She didn't know how to read and write. シャルローネ offered to teach キキ.

---

I want try all the options and continue with the シャルローネ one so I will leave that as the final. Let's try to know about マルー.

```

マルー was finishing her work. マルー is kind of mad at him at first. They still went all the way.

---

Next is 光, she has been there to make a lot of jokes. 光 has taken care of protagonist for a long time. I am so curious about what will 光 do when 陛下 just comes to try have sex with her.

```

光 is surprisingly blissful. They still make some ツッコミ jokes. 光 didn't allow 陛下 to kiss but she gave him a fellatio section.

---

```

ソフィーヤ did fellatio to 陛下. ソフィーヤ is kind of obsessed about 陛下 sometime calls her `ソフィーヤ` but not `ソフィー`. 陛下 proposed to call ソフィーヤ as `フィーちゃん` but she rejected it.

---

シャルローネ appeared to be a very interesting girl during the last few scenes.

```

シャルローネ's voice and lines are a little bit off during this scene - technical problems.

シャルローネ also only gave 陛下 fellatio.

# 02B - キキのスクールライフ

キキ went to school to study. 陛下 and シャルローネ came with her to prevent 変な虫 from sticking to her.

The class was boring. 陛下 felt sleepy. シャルローネ slept without closing her eyes (凄い).

シャルローネ splited キキ into multiple キキ(s). They were curious and asked all kind of questions.

---

That night, シャルローネ and キキ were wating in 陛下's room. And シャルローネ left. And 陛下 and キキ got to know each others. キキ confessed to 陛下 and he also loved her.

# 03A - 強がりシャルローネ

陛下 woke up in the morning and found シャルローネ was beside him.

Everyone knew from キキ's reaction that 陛下 and キキ had already have sex with each others.

---

光 got bored from doing the "producing energy stones" work and wanted to have a more fantasy world. There is a magic item that will create anything from the user's imagination. 陛下 created 1000 人妻美尻スライム.

---

陛下 came back to the castle and got bored in his room. シャルローネ came to visit 陛下. シャルローネ got on the bed with him. シャルローネ invited 陛下 to a date around the castle's gate.

It seems that シャルローネ loves animal. シャルローネ wanted to become a bird as she loved adventure.

---

It seems that シャルローネ was tired from the date this afternoon so there is no options to visit her at night.

Is this some kind of routine?

```
x 光の部屋
x ソフィーヤの部屋
  キキの部屋
x マルーの部屋
```

Yep, 光 and others were doing the same thing as last time. Maybe it was because I chose シャルローネ last time, シャルローネ option was longer available.

Let's move on with キキ.

```

キキ only did a handjob section.

---

In the middle of the night, 陛下 heard someone was crying. It was シャルローネ. What's a surprise. シャルローネ doesn't look like someone who would cry alone in the middle of the night. I wonder what was her burden.

# 03B - シャルローネと親子

The following day, everyone noticed there was something between 陛下 and シャルローネ. Everyone showed to be busy or did their own thing to leave the two alone.

陛下 invited シャルローネ to go around with him. 陛下 gave シャルローネ his smartphone and made her curious about it. 陛下 tried to give a call to his mother and she picked up. 陛下 let シャルローネ talk with his mother. They had a great time together.

---

After done with the "energy stone" work, ソフィーヤ wanted to gave 陛下 a kiss but he said that there was no need for that. When ソフィーヤ kissed him, she told that 陛下 was thinking about another girl and stated that the girl was シャルローネ. シャルローネ then came and gave a kiss. シャルローネ confessed to 陛下 and asked if he loves her as a person but not as the king of the country. 陛下 told her to give him sometime to think about it. シャルローネ then left the "energy stone" place.

陛下 went around the town to find シャルローネ but can't find her anywhere. 陛下 found シャルローネ on the main street. For some reason, シャルローネ held 陛下 right arm and looked at a lost kid. Her mother came right away. It seems that シャルローネ was in some kind of homesick.

> シャルローネ: そうね、帰りたい

> シャルローネ: あの頃に戻れるなら、私...

陛下 ran to ミンティ place and tried to buy her flower. As 陛下 didn't not bring any money with him, he summoned ソフィーヤ. And ソフィーヤ summoned ルル. 陛下 did get the flower and gave it to シャルローネ. When 陛下 was about to give シャルローネ his reply, シャルローネ told him to do that at night.

---

At night, 陛下 came to シャルローネ's room. When 陛下 was about the give his 返事 about シャルローネ's 告白, シャルローネ kissed him. 陛下 then deflowered シャルローネ.

---

シャルローネ wanted to call 陛下 `お兄様` as she didn't want to call him the same as everyone.

# 04A - <ruby>幼馴染<rt>おさななじ</rt>みの<rt></rt>決意<rt>けつい</rt></ruby>

In the morning, ソフィーヤ, シャルローネ and キキ all got into 陛下's bed. 光 came in to tell that breakfest was ready in a cold tone and left.

After many years together with 陛下, 光 couldn't make 陛下 to make a move on her. However, after coming to this world, 陛下 made love with 3 lovely girls. 光 wondered what all the trouble she had been through was for. 光 asked everyone to leave her alone.

After graduated 中3 (9th grade), 陛下 confessed to 光 but she turned him down. However, it was because that day was the April Fools' Day. 光 did ask what 陛下 liked about her and he said `分からん`. 光 and 陛下 argued with each others about all those past events. 陛下 finally kissed 光 and everything was settled down. 光 was frustrated about that she wanted a more romantic proposal.

---

Everyone prepared a dance party for 陛下 and 光.

At night, while 陛下 was taking a bath, 光 came in without knowning that he was there. It seems that シャルローネ tricked 光. 光 told 陛下 to leave her alone that night as she wanted to sort out her thought.

---

I will choose to go to シャルローネの部屋 tonight as I thought that option was no longer available. And I wanted to leave マルー's virginity as she is as I wonder what will happen in the future scene (マルー was the only one who would have sex in these routine night options).

```

シャルローネ came out and pulled 陛下 into her room.

# 04B - ダンスパーティー

陛下 and 光 had a date before dance party. 陛下 brought 光 to the river as 光 loves swimming.

陛下 confessed all his fetishes for 光 but 光 had already known them all.

# 05A - マルーお姉ちゃん

I think 光 will no longer do the blowjob thing this time anymore.

```

Nope, it was still the same as last time with a little modification but it still wasn't appropriate with the current story flow.

ソフィーヤ was also the same as many days ago.

# 05B - 過去の記憶

マルー got sick and everyone became pathetic. The story itself was also gotten in a pathetic state.

I think 陛下 was born from this world. When 陛下 was 8 years old, he was transported to Japan/Earth. And マルー might be 陛下's お姉ちゃん.

# 06 - ハーレムの形

Wedding was the following day.

Wild 弟 appeared!

マルー wanted 陛下 to think about どんな生活 after the "ハーレム" wedding tomorrow.

A weird "ハーレム" fairy appeared!

---

# 土属性ルート 01

The loading screen kept showing キキ with the 土 symbol.

Everyone came back and forth between Japan/Earth and this world.

# 土属性ルート 02

陛下 didn't want to work that day.

ソフィーヤ made 陛下 a drink that made his チンコ disappeared.

シャルローネ did the ナルト thing with 陛下's 肛門.

It ended pretty terrible for 陛下.

# 土属性ルート 03

# 土属性ルート 04

キキ forced everyone to do physical training.
