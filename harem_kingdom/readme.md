# Harem Kingdom

## UI

The game was made for `1280x720` screen resolution. Because of that, on large screen, there are some method to scale the game in full screen mode.

```
ワイドスクリーン (wide screen)
  レターボックス (letter box)
  フルサイズ (full size)
  補正なし (do nothing)
```

I didn't see any different between the `レターボックス` and the `フルサイズ` options.
