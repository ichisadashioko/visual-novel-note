のえ can be quite mischievous.

# 04/21 (のえ level 1 event)

秋 met のえ on the way to school. のえ did not look very well. They were going to have physical education that day. のえ was not font of doing activity as she was bad at it.

のえ lied to be unwell to サボリ the バレーボール thing. <ruby>秋<rt>あき</rt></ruby> found her. のえ lying 姿は可愛い.

They then talked about アリ (ant). のえ loved 虫 and she was observing アリ.

のえ asked 秋 about city girls. のえ seemed want to become a ギャル. While 秋 was explaining about ギャル, のえ paid her attention the people in the physical education building. 秋 noticed that and told のえ about going back with the classmates.

# 04/22 (03)

> <ruby>昇降口<rt>しょうこうぐち</rt></ruby>

<ruby>奈々<rt>なな</rt></ruby> and のえ were there and thinking about something. 奈々 wanted some spice in their 日常. 秋 then acted as 宇宙人 and scared the heck out of 奈々.

```
x 俺もいつもの日常がいいわ
- たまに宇宙人乗り移るけどよろしくね
- のえ先生も宇宙人やってみてよ
```

# 04/25 (04)

> 図書室

のえ was reading while walking in the room. 秋 told her that was dangerous. のえ was reading the book titled "本当の自分とは？".

のえ was then teased by 秋 and 奈々.

```
- やるからには吹っ切れきゃいけない
- じゃあ、仕返しを楽しみにしてるね
x からかいがいがあるなぁ、のえ先生は
```

# 04/26 (のえ level 2 event)

秋's female classmates captured him to ask a bunch of questions. I think のえ had shown some interest in 秋 and the other female classmates noticed that (48%).

のえ and 秋 spent time in the library after 先生 asked 秋 to bring something to the library. 秋 mostly listened to のえの夢中話.

# 04/27 (05)

> 食堂

のえ was there with 奈々. 奈々 asked のえ to massage her. のえ also massaged 秋. While のえ was wondering about is massage really that 気持ちいい, 秋 told her to let him massage her. のえ felt really good and gave off 変な声 during the process.

On the way home,

The first option seemed like the most "gentle" option.

```
x のえ先生がまたやってくれるなら (✔)
- 録音させてくれるなら
- お断りします
```

# 04/29 (06)

> <ruby>昇降口<rt>しょうこうぐち</rt></ruby>

のえ asked 秋 to read some books with her? No one asks people to read books together with no reasons.

---

突然、のえは質問がある

> 今、幸せですか？

```
- え、何？煽ってるの？
x 幸せです
- もっと幸せになりたいです
```

# 05/02 (07)

> 二年教室

のえ was reading book in the classroom. They were guessing how to read some uncommon Japanese names.

> のえ:　<ruby>こうなりたいって<rt></rt>苗字<rt>みょうじ</rt>、あります？</ruby>

```
- 大道寺
x 如月 (✔)
- 御薬袋
```

It was のえ's 苗字.

# 05/04 (08)

> <ruby>渡<rt>わた</rt>り<rt></rt>廊下<rt>ろうか</rt></ruby>

The topic was 早口言葉 that time.

```
x 気にしなくていいと思うよ
- 気にしなくて···ぷぷっ！
- 気にしなさい
```

# 05/06 (09)

> <ruby>二階<rt>にかい</rt>廊下<rt>ろうか</rt></ruby>

のえ and 奈々 were playing a multi-player game with their smartphones. I think they were talking about <ruby>妖怪<rt>ようかい</rt></ruby>. They looked for books that had some specific 妖怪?

```
- 美少女なら
x 狐可愛いもんな
- 美味いのかな
```

# 05/07 (のえ level 3 event)

There were only のえ and 秋 at the 図書室. No one else came to the 図書室 that day.

奈々 called のえ and invited her to the pool. However, のえ declined with no specific reason. 秋 then invited のえ to the beach. They then walked to the beach. Both of them didn't know how to swim.

のえ was so embarrassed when 秋 pointed out that they were on a date.

のえ called 秋 "小早川くん". Thanks. SMEE/HOOKSOFT, please just give the protagonist a single name. I do not need name customization. I want to hear the heroines say the protagonist name. Fuck off 'あなた' or 'きみ'.

のえ was jealous about (if) 秋 also いじわるしたり and 優しくしてくれたり with 他の子. And she said it directly to 秋.

> のえ:　女の子が相手なら、誰でもいいと···？

```
  そらは逆に問題だ！
x 初めて来た男子が俺で良かったの？
```

```
x 気になる男子について聞いてみる
  環の話題を振ってみる
```

# 05/09 (10)

I think this is the final turn. Ten sounds like a good number. <ruby>椎名<rt>しいな</rt></ruby> did not show up after school a lot of days so that may be why <ruby>椎名<rt>しいな</rt></ruby> took so more turns than のえ route.

> 二年教室

のえ did not know how to ride bicycle.

I think this is still not the final push for のえ route.

> のえ:　<ruby>えっと、私のイメージって、どう思います？</ruby>

The third choice was probably the worst way to answer this question.

```
x 可愛いかな
- たくましいかな
- どうでもいい
```

# 05/11 (11)

> <ruby>職員室<rt>しょくいんしつ</rt></ruby>

秋 joked about he was wearing pink パンツ that day.

```
- 自然はいいものだ
x ノーサンキューで
- 自然以外で、どうかひとつ
```

I had no idea why would the second choice was the right one.

# 05/13 (12)

> 図書室

They talked about animals. のえ talked a lot about some animals that are dangerous than they appear to be.

```
- じゃあ一番好きな動物は？
  俺、蚊より怖い生き物がいる
x のえ先生が怖い (✔)
```

# 05/16 (13)

# 05/17 (のえ level 4 event)

のえ brought some cabbages to ウメ婆's house. のえ seemed embarrassed when she met 秋 there. ウメ婆ちゃん had gone out. のえ ran off.
