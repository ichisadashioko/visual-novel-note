<ruby>主人公<rt>しゅじんこう</rt>の<rt></rt>名前<rt>なまえ</rt>は<rt></rt>辻堂<rt>つじどう</rt>忠臣<rt>ただおみ</rt>。</ruby>

忠臣 was remembering back about when he was a grade schooler during his sleep. 忠臣's friend - ケンちゃん - was bought something (パンチンコ) and 忠臣 was not. 忠臣 thought the world was unfair to him and shouted out from his dream. <ruby>英<rt>はなぶさ</rt>麻耶<rt>まや</rt></ruby> was with 忠臣 and tried to wake him up.

> いい加減、人の話を聞きなさいよ

麻耶 is 委員長 and 忠臣's classmate. I believe that 忠臣 is the 副委員長. No, it seems that 麻耶 is the <ruby>生<rt>せい</rt>徒<rt>と</rt>会<rt>かい</rt>長<rt>ちょう</rt></ruby> and <ruby>忠臣<rt>ただおみ</rt></ruby> is the <ruby>委<rt>い</rt>員<rt>いん</rt>長<rt>ちょう</rt></ruby>. 忠臣 is also the <ruby>風<rt>ふう</rt>紀<rt>き</rt>委<rt>い</rt>員<rt>いん</rt></ruby>. They was having a meeting and 忠臣 slept and talked while sleeping. I wonder if there were other people attending the meeting other than those two.

> これは罰が必要ね

As 麻耶 had shown to be quite aggressive, I would love to be led by heroines in this title.

```

忠臣 is from <ruby>豪<rt>ごう</rt>傑<rt>けつ</rt>館<rt>かん</rt>学<rt>がく</rt>園<rt>えん</rt></ruby>. And there is a all-girl school called <ruby>綴<rt>つづ</rt>葉<rt>は</rt></ruby> nearby.

As some students was talking about finding a girlfriend to enjoy the summer with, 忠臣 became desperate for finding a girlfriend. And 忠臣 was about to do ナンパ (go around and talk to random girls on the street in the attempt to hook up with them). For some reason, 忠臣 and his buddy still call each other with their last name, <ruby>辻堂<rt>つじどう</rt></ruby> and <ruby>大八木<rt>おおやぎ</rt></ruby> respectively.

While <ruby>辻堂<rt>つじどう</rt>忠臣<rt>ただおみ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>大八木<rt>おおやぎ</rt>優<rt>すぐる</rt></ruby> were talking about ナンパ, there was a girl in trouble. She was walking with a cane and was trying to cross the road. She is kind of trying to looking for help. <ruby>辻堂<rt>つじどう</rt>忠臣<rt>ただおみ</rt></ruby> came to help her. The girl looked a little confused. <ruby>辻堂<rt>つじどう</rt>忠臣<rt>ただおみ</rt></ruby> tried to get her across the road and not to scared her. As the girl looked like a foreigner, <ruby>辻堂<rt>つじどう</rt>忠臣<rt>ただおみ</rt></ruby> told her "アイ·アム·ノット·ア·ドッグ" (I am not a dog).

After 忠臣 helped the girl, he said goodbye to her and ran off without telling her his name as he think she will report him. It is because the girl is beautiful and 忠臣 think that 忠臣 thought that he was kind of trying to hook up with her as he is not an イケメン and 忠臣 was about to do ナンパ.

I think this game might only have 2 main choices. Here might be the second one and we will get straight into a specific heroine route. Even though <ruby>種村<rt>たねむら</rt>小柚子<rt>こゆず</rt></ruby> seems to be the main heroine as she appears in the game cover, I will go with <ruby>英<rt>はなぶさ</rt>麻耶<rt>まや</rt></ruby> first. It is because <ruby>麻耶<rt>まや</rt></ruby> has shown to be a quite unique character to me.

```

```

忠臣 is about to call out 麻耶 without knowing that it is her. This will be a lot of fun.

```
x 声をかける
  場所を変える
```

> 麻耶: あら? あらあら?

As we are having a date with girl, I think we should focus on her instead of the food. I am sure how will this go.

```
x 見返す
  食事を続ける
```

As 麻耶 went to clean her face, 忠臣 noticed that the couple nearby talking about the girl's seat gone cold. I think 忠臣 ordered something for 麻耶.
