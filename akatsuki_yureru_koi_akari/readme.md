# [<ruby>紅月<rt>あかつき</rt>ゆれる<rt></rt>恋<rt>こい</rt>あかり</ruby>](https://crystalia.amusecraft.com/yureaka/index.html)

The protagonist - <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> - looks so annoying because of his face and hair style. I wish they would have designed a more handsome protagonist sprite. Poor those beautiful and 格好いい heroines.

<ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> became the teacher of the high school which he graduated from a few years ago (his face is so annoying). A female teacher - <ruby>佐々木<rt>ささき</rt>巫琴<rt>みこと</rt></ruby> - told him that he will be assigned a special class - full of 可愛い女の子たち.

<ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> went to the "gym" where students duel with each others. <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>天王寺<rt>てんのうじ</rt>ヴィクトリア</ruby> was dueling there.

<ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> comes from a famous family about sword-wielding.

<ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> stayed there as an audience and talked with <ruby>源<rt>みなもと</rt>雫<rt>しずく</rt></ruby> - a third year student. <ruby>源<rt>みなもと</rt>雫<rt>しずく</rt></ruby> is a very shy girl around <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> and she also comes from a quite famous household - <ruby>源<rt>みなもと</rt></ruby>.

A little while later, <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> intrudes <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>天王寺<rt>てんのうじ</rt>ヴィクトリア</ruby>'s duel. <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> complained about that <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> has kept avoiding her dual challenge (for 3 months). I think <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> thinks <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> is a very 面倒くさいな人. I also think that too.

<ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> keeps avoiding <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby>'s challenge and tells <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> that she is dueling with <ruby>天王寺<rt>てんのうじ</rt>ヴィクトリア</ruby>. However, <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> didn't back down for another time. <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> starts to attack <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>. <ruby>天王寺<rt>てんのうじ</rt>ヴィクトリア</ruby> also joins <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> and attacks <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>.

After exchanging a few attacks, <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> knocked <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> down. <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> gets up and turns into berserk mode. <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> knocked down <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>天王寺<rt>てんのうじ</rt>ヴィクトリア</ruby> even though <ruby>天王寺<rt>てんのうじ</rt>ヴィクトリア</ruby> didn't attack <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> got berserk previous and injured some teachers, <ruby>源<rt>みなもと</rt>雫<rt>しずく</rt></ruby> told <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> in a panic tone. For that reason, she has been transfered to a special class - which he is going to be in charge of.

<ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> went in to conform <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby>. He is annoyingly strong for whatever reasons. He knocked <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> down and brought her sense back later.

While <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> was bringing <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> to <ruby>佐々木<rt>ささき</rt>巫琴<rt>みこと</rt></ruby>, she exhausted and he had to carry her to the <ruby>保健室<rt>ほけんしつ</rt></ruby>. <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> got chance to talk with <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> a little while later and got to know that she is also in the special class. <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> told him that he doesn't need to care much about her and spend that time to take care of other students - <ruby>風嶺<rt>かざみね</rt>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby>. <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> is kind of a dick and doesn't seem to accept what she said. <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> got annoyed and left.

<ruby>九鬼<rt>くき</rt>旭<rt>あさひ</rt></ruby> "assaulted" <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> from behind without being realized. They have known each others since a long time a ago. <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> was <ruby>友人<rt>ゆうじん</rt></ruby> with <ruby>九鬼<rt>くき</rt>旭<rt>あさひ</rt>の<rt></rt>兄<rt>あに</rt></ruby>. For some whatever reasons, <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> didn't contact with <ruby>九鬼<rt>くき</rt>旭<rt>あさひ</rt></ruby> for the last few years. She said something very ヤンデレっぽい. <ruby>九鬼<rt>くき</rt>旭<rt>あさひ</rt></ruby> doesn't seem to be in the special class. However, I think she is going to make her way into that class. <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> used to "teach" <ruby>九鬼<rt>くき</rt>旭<rt>あさひ</rt></ruby> about <ruby>刃道<rt>じんどう</rt></ruby> when she started out.

The "gym" was called <ruby>競技場<rt>きょうぎじょう</rt></ruby> - an arena.

The "special class" was called <ruby>篁組<rt>TODO</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> looks at the attendance data of his class and finds that there is student named <ruby>十部<rt>とべ</rt>梨々夢<rt>りりむ</rt></ruby> who reported having poor physical health (<ruby>体調不良<rt>たいちょうふりょう</rt></ruby>) and is taking absense but she is still staying at the school dormitory.

The school's name is <ruby>叢雲<rt>TODO</rt>学園<rt>がくえん</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> was about to go into the dormitory to find <ruby>十部<rt>とべ</rt>梨々夢<rt>りりむ</rt></ruby>. However, <ruby>十部<rt>とべ</rt>梨々夢<rt>りりむ</rt></ruby> comes out from the dormitory. She does not look like having weak physical health at all.

Swords in this world is called オリガミ.

<ruby>十部<rt>とべ</rt>梨々夢<rt>りりむ</rt></ruby> complained that the teachers can't teach her anything so she skips classes. <ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> challenges her in a duel in exchange to get her to come to the class.

<ruby>十部<rt>とべ</rt>梨々夢<rt>りりむ</rt></ruby>'s special move is <ruby>八紘我観<rt>world is mine</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>村垣<rt>むらがき</rt>伊織<rt>いおり</rt></ruby> beated <ruby>十部<rt>とべ</rt>梨々夢<rt>りりむ</rt></ruby> without using any special moves. She promised that she will come to class later and ran off.

I finished playing this title in 4 days. The game structure is quite unique from all the titles that I have played so far. There is only a single route. We don't have any options for story branching. That only route is "the common route" - "no sexual content" expect for <ruby>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> doing オナニー. The whole main content is in that route. After we read the event that targets to the specific heroine. The H-scene will be unlocked for that heroine. However, that scene does not follow the story. It is just the "what-if" scene like illusion. After we finished the main story, the extra story for each heroines is unlocked in the "SPECIAL" section. They are short-length (asaproject's sub-heroines route length).

<ruby>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>'s final CG was the only without nudity.

After finishing the game, I decided to pick up the 絆きらめく恋いろは title and realized that they re-used all the background assets.

I wished <ruby>旭<rt>あさひ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月花<rt>せつげっか</rt></ruby> had chance to win the tornament. I felt a little bit unfair as <ruby>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> won. It feels like <ruby>紅葉<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was being backed by the <ruby>朱雀院<rt>すざくいん</rt></ruby> from the previous title - especially <ruby>椿<rt>つばき</rt></ruby>.
