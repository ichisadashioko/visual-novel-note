What? Name customization? The dialog is going to be very awkward. If it is not, I would appriciate all the 声優たち who did twice the work for the intended experience (the default name). 

The protagonist's name (default name) is <ruby>新見<rt>にいみ</rt>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. I hope that the dialog will use this default name instead of あなた or きみ.

<ruby>二年生<rt>にねんせい</rt>A<rt></rt>組<rt>ぐみ</rt></ruby> (sound like the top class of his grade - A class)

__四月十一日（月曜日）__

> <ruby>...<rt></rt>銀色<rt>ぎんいろ</rt>の<rt></rt>雪<rt>ゆき</rt></ruby>

<ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby> is the town name. They had snow in April and it was not an uncommon thing. The town was covered in snow.

> <ruby>春<rt>はる</rt>休<rt>やす</rt>みが<rt></rt>昨日<rt>きの</rt>で<rt></rt>終<rt>お</rt>わり、<rt></rt>俺<rt>おれ</rt>はこの<rt></rt>日<rt>ひ</rt>から、<rt></rt>中学<rt>ちゅうがく</rt>二年生<rt>にねんせい</rt>になる</ruby>

What? <ruby>新見<rt>にいみ</rt>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was only 14 years old.

> <ruby>そして<rt></rt>何<rt>なに</rt>より<rt></rt>今日<rt>きょう</rt>は<rt></rt>妹<rt>いもうと</rt>、<rt></rt>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt>の<rt></rt>入学式<rt>にゅうがくしき</rt>。</ruby>

We have <ruby>石原<rt>いしはら</rt>舞<rt>まい</rt></ruby> to voice <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>. <ruby>石原<rt>いしはら</rt>舞<rt>まい</rt></ruby> had been streaming a lot of games lately.

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> was only a year younger than <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> so that was probably why she was so reversed to <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> became <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt>妹<rt>いもうと</rt></ruby> because her mother - <ruby>優子<rt>ゆうこ?</rt></ruby> - married his father. That event was 1 year before.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> called <ruby>優子<rt>ゆうこ</rt></ruby> as 優子さん. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s father's name is <ruby>恒一<rt>こういち?</rt></ruby>.

Great, others called the protagonist as <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>.

While the family was having breakfast, the news on the television announced that <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> - a professional skater had come back to the town (<ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby>). <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> referred <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> as <ruby>瑞<rt>みず</rt>ねぇ</ruby>.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> made a snowman to celebrate <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt>の<rt></rt>入学<rt>にゅうがく</rt></ruby> day.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XyLqhGC.png)

---

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> previously lived in a town called <ruby>樽倉<rt>たるくら</rt></ruby> which was 40 kilometers from their house. That day was the first time they go to school together (<ruby>登校<rt>とうこう</rt>する</ruby>). <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> played しりとり on their way to school.

When they came to the school front, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> received a メール and he was about to leave <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> alone. I guessed <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was going to <ruby>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>'s place. Nope, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> went to his mother's store. Her name is <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby>. <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby> had proper illustrations (poor 優子さん). <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby> looks like a very beautiful person. I wonder why did they divorce. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> helped まりあ by clearing the snow.

まりあ seemed to be very friendly toward <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>. I wonder how messy was their family relationship. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was late for the <ruby>入学式<rt>にゅうがくしき</rt></ruby> and he hadn't known which class he was in yet. The teacher told <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> to wait in a room. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> met a blonde hair girl there (third heroine appeared) - <ruby>転校生<rt>てんこうせい</rt>さん</ruby>.

From my experience with 月かな, the first option will contribute to this girl route. And those early choices often do not affect other heroines' routes.

```
x 挨拶する
  様子を見る
```

The girl did reply back and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> thought that she was good at <ruby>日本語<rt>にほんご</rt></ruby>. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> then started to talking to the girl but she seemed to be trouble and was having a hard time to reply.

> いっぱいの日本語···わからない

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> then used his broken English to say sorry but the girl seemed to not get it. The girl only understood that <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was introducing himself when <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> wrote his name in ローマ字 on his notebook. The girl name is Bethly Rose Daisley. I hope they would just use the English characters for Bethly's name instead of the stupid ローマ字 for the rest of the game. Nope, they refered Bethly as ベルリー.

It seemed <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and Bethly were in the same class. Their teacher came to guide them to the class.

> 先生も英語は苦手か

That sounds very harsh for Bethly. Come on Visual Arts', the best way to create an English speaking person who is not good at Japanese is to have them to speak fluent English that most Japanese cannot understand and have them to speak broken and weird Japanese that most Japanese cannot understand.

---

Bethly and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> introduced themselves to the class.

![](https://i.imgur.com/RlCdAHr.png)

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was the one sits next to <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. This was their first meeting.

Only <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> talked to Bethly during break time. As <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> taught Bethly about the word <ruby>納得<rt>なっとく</rt></ruby>, Bethly had been using it all the time which was a problem as she was using it wrong.

Bethly did not have any interests in 日本.

---

After school, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> came to meet <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>. <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> is a year older than <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and two of them seemed to know each others for a long time. <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> did not talk much during the first few minutes when they met each others (after a long time). <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> was shocked when <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> called her <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>先輩<rt>せんぱい</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> promised something with <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> before she went aboard in <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> (お嫁さんになります?).

---

While <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was waiting for <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> after school, he saw a first year girl and she knew <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s name.

![](https://i.imgur.com/9EtqrRQ.png)

The girl's name is <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby>. <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> is <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>'s classmate. <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> wanted to go home together with <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>. However, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> were about to go to まりあ's store. Three of them went there. The family did have to explain their family relationship to <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby>.

---

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> had dinner together. Their parents were late on that day.

The choices' meaning is so fuzzy. The second option looked like <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> would treat <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> as 妹 only.

```
  いいに決まってるだろ？
x もちろん、付き合うよ
```

__四月十二日（火曜日）__

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> asked <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> about <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>先輩</ruby>.

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was into <ruby>演劇<rt>えんげき</rt></ruby>. <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> lived in the <ruby>関東<rt>かんとう</rt></ruby> region before going to the current school. <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> talked about her <ruby>演劇<rt>えんげき</rt></ruby> hobby during her first year.

```
x 是非すぐに見せてほし
  いつか見せてほし
```

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> got to use a single <ruby>携帯<rt>けいたい</rt>カイロ</ruby> with Bethly and <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>. Bethly was a little embarrassed as all of their hands touched each others.

---

<ruby>放課後<rt>ほうかご</rt></ruby>

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>, <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> and <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> came to the skating ground. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> still called <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> using her last name and she was still annoyed by that. 二人まだ仲直りをした.

We had a flaskback about <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>, <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>, and <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby>.

---

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> remembered back about when she first met <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>.

---

__<ruby>四月<rt>よんがつ</rt>十四日<rt>じゅうよっか</rt>（<rt></rt>木曜日<rt>もくようび</rt>）</ruby>__

When <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was coming back to the classroom from the toilet, <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> was there and hugged him. <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> wanted to surprise <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> led <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> to an empty classroom and told him to get his clothes off. Oh, <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> wanted to fix a loosen button on <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s 制服.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> thanked <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> for fixing his clothes. <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> then told <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> to call her as ヒナ from now on.

---

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> saw <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> go to the empty classroom. I guessed <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was there for practising <ruby>演劇<rt>えんげき</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was amazed by <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>'s acting.

```

__<ruby>四月<rt>よんがつ</rt>十五日<rt>じゅうごにち</rt>（<rt></rt>金曜日<rt>きんようび</rt>）</ruby>__

Bethly was having trouble with some dishes during <ruby>給食<rt>きゅうしょく</rt></ruby> and asked <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. I think Bethly was having trouble with unknown food.

```

---

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> realized what made <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> act strangely and came to her practising place to apologize.

```
x 俺も会いたかった

```

__<ruby>四月<rt>よんがつ</rt>十六日<rt>じゅうろくにち</rt>（<rt></rt>土曜日<rt>どようび</rt>）</ruby>__

<ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> was coming to <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s house (probably to play with <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>).

I wanted to meet some other heroine. My first priority was <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>.

```
x 牛乳を買いに行く

Nope, that was fast. No encounter happened.

When <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> brought the drink for <ruby>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby>, he heard <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt>のエロ声</ruby>.

<ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> was so focus on the マンガ and didn't notice that her パンツ was revealing.

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> sent <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> a note during class. It wrote:

---

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was going to eat outside that day. There was a restaurant that まりあ suggested the other day. Coincidencely, <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> was there. <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> seemed a little bit worried about her diet before eating.

I wanted to make <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> blush a little bit.

```

```

__04/22(金曜日)__

There was a beatiful teaching assistant that knew <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s mother - まりあ. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> led her to まりあ's store. They drank, sang, and played violin there.

__04/23(土曜日)__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> blackmailed ももちゃん先生 for something.

__04/25(月曜日)__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was luring <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> into his ultimate harem plan.

```
x 雪月にも参加してほしいんだ
  嫌だったら、無理にとは言わないけど
```

__04/26(火曜日)__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was making "poster" for his "harem plan" but his drawing is terrible. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> got Bethly to draw and found out that Bethly was good at drawing. Bethly's mother was an artist. However, she had already passed away.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> looked up about Bethly's mother that night.

__04/27(水曜日)__

It was <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>'s turn to be lured into <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s "harem plan".

```
x もう少し粘ってみる

```

__05/04(水曜日)__

<ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> did decide to participate in <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s "harem plan" even though she was not sure what she was going to do there.

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> considered to participate in the <ruby>ワンルーム<rt>one room</rt>学級<rt>がっきゅう</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>'s coach saw <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s flyer that <ruby>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> was crying with and got her to talk about it.

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> left a thank you note on <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s clothes while he was taking a bath.

Bethly looked at her mother paintings with her dad. Bethly had flashback about her mother and she were playing under the snow together.

__05/07(金曜日)__

Bethly hadn't gone back to school after Golden Week.

__05/09__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> asked ももちゃん先生 to see whether she knew anything about why Bethly hadn't not gone to school.

ゴメン、椛.

```
x 気になります
  違いますよ
```

ももちゃん先生 revealed that Bethly's father is a pilot. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was finding reason to come to see Bethly at her house.

__05/10__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> got permission to come to Bethly's house. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> then came to Bethly's house. They met Bethly's dad - Brian. It seemed that Bethly was not going to show herself. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> invited Brian to まりあ's store.

まりあ, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> made some pancakes for Bethly before Brian came home. Bethly realized <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt>の<rt></rt>下手<rt>へた</rt>な<rt></rt>絵<rt>え</rt></ruby> that he drew on the pancakes.

__05/12(木曜日)__

Bethly came to school that day. Bethly thanked <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> for the pancake at the other day. That was the first time <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> saw Bethly smiles.

__05/13(金曜日)__

All the heroines went to the <ruby>ワンルーム<rt></rt>学級<rt>がっきゅう</rt></ruby> thing. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> talked about some mountain. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> also got Bethly to talk about Canada and her mother.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and Bethly went to home together that day (with some other people). Please stop using your broken English.

__05/15(日曜日)__

It seemed that the group would climb the mountain that <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> presented at the <ruby>ワンルーム<rt></rt>がっきゅう<rt></ruby> the other day. <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> was too excited for it so she didn't have much sleep the night before. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> helped <ruby>優子<rt>ゆうこ</rt></ruby> make <ruby>弁当<rt>べんとう</rt></ruby> for the trip that day. They made enough for 7 people (雪兎 (1), <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> (2), <ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> (3), <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> (4), Bethly (5), <ruby>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> (6), ももちゃん先生 (7)).

---

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> were the first ones to be at the gathering location. <ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> was being ナンパ.

The 彼女 option sounded fun.

```
x 俺の彼女がどうかしましたか？

<ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> was only being asked for direction by two foreigners.

It seemed that Bethly would not come. The six of them went on their trip without Bethly.

Bethly was already on the snow mountain and making a <ruby>小<rt>ちい</rt>さな<rt></rt>雪<rt>ゆき</rt>だるま</ruby> alone. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> only found her after hearing her "くちゅんっ". Could anyone just fix Bethly's "<ruby>納得<rt>なっとく</rt></ruby>".

<ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> presented at the <ruby>ワンルーム<rt></rt>学級<rt>がっきゅう</rt></ruby>. She called <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> two days before and asked for suggestion.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was the one to teach/introduce <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> to skating. <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> was very shy when she first met <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> but she opened to him like a few minutes later when he brought her to the park.

It would be <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>'s turn in the next <ruby>ワンルーム<rt></rt>学級<rt>がっきゅう</rt></ruby> that day. Everyone was amazed by <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>'s acting. They would about to perform a [play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)).

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> went to <ruby>商店街<rt>しょうてんがい</rt></ruby> to brought the equipments. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> "deceived" <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> into coming to his house. The restaurant that <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> came to before, was <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>'s house. The two became neighbors.

まりあ teased <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> when he brought <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> to the store.

__05/28(土曜日)__

<ruby>雛多<rt>ひたな</rt></ruby> was driving off the script. I would be mad if someone messed up the script on the stage. It would end up pretty bad. Bad <ruby>雛多<rt>ひたな</rt></ruby>.

They came to まりあ's store that night to celebrate. I think this would be the end of the <ruby>ワンルーム<rt></rt>学級<rt>がっきゅう</rt></ruby> arc.

The opening movie rolled out. <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> seemed to be the one with the most screen time. <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> had become so beautiful in highschool (in the OP).

__06/08(水曜日)__

The day started at <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s house where he and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> were preparing to go to school. That day was too warm but they still "have to" wear the winter <ruby>制服<rt>せいふく</rt></ruby> until June 20th.

Middle-school pool arc?

Yep, cleaning pool arc was coming. Our good boy <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> volunteered to clean the school pool. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was going to drag all the heroines with him. <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> and Bethly were going to be <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s first victims. Yep, <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was the first one to get caught.

<ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> might have to clean the school pool as she was texting so much about it on LIME.

__06/11(土曜日)__

That day was the pool cleaning day. It seemed that nobody who had to clean the pool, came except for <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>.

> <ruby>体育<rt>たいいく</rt>教師<rt>きょうし</rt>:　やられた</ruby>

Who would be the first to come and "rescue" <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>? It was Bethly.

Bethly got change in front of <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. Well, Bethly probably wore <ruby>水着<rt>みずぎ</rt></ruby> under her <ruby>制服<rt>せいふく</rt></ruby>. Sorry writers, I just read/watched too much. It is not your fault.

Please fix Bethly's <ruby>納得<rt>なっとく</rt></ruby>! How many chapters had passed?

__06/19(日曜日)__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and Bethly would have a date that day. What? Bethly's father - Brian - was out that day. Can we just get into Bethly route right there? How can <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> just easily invite girls to come to his house? イケメン?

ゲームセンター店員、テンション高いすぎ

Okay, so how much <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> would going to spend to get Bethly something from those shitty machines at the ゲームセンター. Poor Bethly, she was the one to get tricked to spend money.

プリントシール time. Wait for it. Bethly was not deceived this time. 残念.

No Japanese. Do not promote your shitty English accent. Bad Japanese.

__08/10(水曜日)__

That should be done for Bethly. Bethly went back to Canada that summer. Four more heroines more to go. I guessed <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> would be the next one as <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> came to まりあ's store. Nope, only ももちゃん先生 came.

__09/15(木曜日)__

__10/11(火曜日)__

__10/14(金曜日)__

__12/12(月曜日)__

__12/22(木曜日)__

I think we had already in Bethly route.

)

Bethly would move back to Canada when she finished middle school.

__04/12(水曜日)__

What? Didn't you fast-forward too fast? Where was the New Year event?

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> had already falled in love with Bethly but he decided to keep it for himself only and was not going to tell his feeling to Bethly.

We got a glimpse of <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s past about why <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> became いい子. I was still not clear about why did まりあ decide to divorce. I think we might get to explore that in the other routes little by little.

__04/13(木曜日)__

It seemed that everyone realized that 雪兎はベスリーのことが好き.

__04/28(金曜日)__

> ベスリー:　雪だるま、作ろう？

```
x いいな
  この量じゃ無理じゃないか？
```

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> told his feeling to Bethly.

__05/08(月曜日)__

Bethly turned 雪兎 down. Everyone came afteward. I think everyone would try to hook Bethly and 雪兎 up.

__06/07(水曜日)__

__12/11__

雪兎 asked his parent about something. I guessed it would be something like turn their house into a place for foreign students to stay.

That day, Bethly was happy about something. She was about to tell everyone during the ワンルーム学級. It wouldn't be a surprise that Bethly found a way to stay in Japan after middle school. Would Bethly move into 雪兎's house?

Nope, Bethly wanted to hold a Chrismas party.

__12/25__

__02/27__

雪兎 was going to Canada after graduating middle school.

It seemed that 雪兎 was not going to Canada because he failed "some exams"?.

Bethly's flight was cancelled. Nice, writers. You had done your jobs as always. What else should I say? Bethly was really cool after saying those things.

Well, Bethly's flight resumed the following day. Bethly and 雪兎 slept on the bench (at the airport) that day.

## Bethly School

Starting a new chapter. High school arc.

__02/14__

What? A year had passed.

雪兎 and 名白椛 were in the same club in their first year at high school. 名白椛の制服 looked pretty lame. I guessed that why 椛 in the opening with more clothes than just her 制服 looked much more attractive than the others.

The dialog mentioned 遥か here.

__04/12 - 高校二年__

![](https://i.imgur.com/KrLlguq.png)

__04/14 - 日曜日 - 高校二年__

Bethly wore the 制服 on Sunday to go on a date with 雪兎. So this was "that day". Nope, it wasn't.

The 高校制服 is the most lame outfit for all the heroines in this title. Why all the other outfits look fine but not the 高校制服? The 高校制服's shirt (not skirt) is too short. Well, they fixed that problem with the 月かな title. <ruby>灯華<rt>とうか</rt></ruby> is gorgeous in her 制服.

雪兎 was the one to ask Bethly to wear 制服. 雪兎 - you got trash taste there.

雪兎は悪い子なっちゃった

__05/25 - <ruby>土曜日<rt>どようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and Bethly came to the (public) pool. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> taught Bethly to swim. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was having trouble with his libido lately because he and Bethly were flirting with each others a lots lately. I wondered how would Bethly react when she knows about it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/rbsOP1W.png)

Bethly and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> rented some DVDs on their way home. Bethly's English is really annoying. I can read the quote myself but when I heard Bethly read it, I didn't want to even look at the sentence. All the heroines's (expect for <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>'s) breast were getting too big in high school.

__05/27 - <ruby>月曜日<rt>げつようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

Bethly came to the <ruby>図書館<rt>としょかん</rt></ruby> to borrow some books (probably to learn about sexual intercouse).

__05/28 - <ruby>火曜日<rt>かようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

<ruby>放課後<rt>ほうかご</rt></ruby>

ももちゃん先生 was waiting for Bethly as Bethly asked ももちゃん先生 for (sex education) <ruby>相談<rt>そうだん</rt></ruby>. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> came there before Bethly and made the situation a little awkward when Bethly came.

Bethly bought a <ruby>貯金箱<rt>ちょきんばこ</rt></ruby> to save up for ピル (birth-control pill). These teenagers got their shit together. I wondered that would every other heroines going to takle this problem. I think one is enough.

__06/10　- <ruby>月曜日<rt>げつようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> thought that Bethly and he would need around 一万円 ($100). <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> realized that he was going to need to find a part-time job as their saving progress was quite slow. Bethly also wanted to find a part-time job but her position as an exchange student did not allow her to do so.

__06/28 - <ruby>金曜日<rt>きんようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> got contact about his part-time job.

__06/29 - <ruby>土曜日<rt>どようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

<ruby>翌日<rt>よくじつ</rt></ruby>

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> came home at night and looked very tired (from his (part-time) job) that day. It seemed that <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> took up a labour-heavy work. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was very tired that day and fell asleep when Bethly was out for a moment.

__07/01 - <ruby>月曜日<rt>げつようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

No Bethly, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> just needed to pour cold water to that place and it will calm down. Bethly, you were making the matter worse if anyone came to <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s room because the two of you were up there for too long.

__07/04 - <ruby>木曜日<rt>もくようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

__07/15 - <ruby>月曜日<rt>げつようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

__09/16 - <ruby>月曜日<rt>げつようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

It had been around three months already. They saved up around 二万五千円.

__09/22 - <ruby>日曜日<rt>にちようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

Bethly brought 6 months worth of birth-control pills. Starting the following week, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and Bethly were going to have a lots to do. They had 五千円 left.

__09/23 - <ruby>月曜日<rt>げつようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

__09/30 - <ruby>月曜日<rt>げつようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s parent would not come home that day. <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> would stay at <ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby>'s place that day too. That day was the day.
