What? Name customization? The dialog is going to be very awkward. If it is not, I would appriciate all the 声優たち who did twice the work for the intended experience (the default name). 

The protagonist's name (default name) is <ruby>新見<rt>にいみ</rt>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. I hope that the dialog will use this default name instead of あなた or きみ.

<ruby>二年生<rt>にねんせい</rt>A<rt></rt>組<rt>ぐみ</rt></ruby> (sound like the top class of his grade - A class)

__四月十一日（月曜日）__

> <ruby>...<rt></rt>銀色<rt>ぎんいろ</rt>の<rt></rt>雪<rt>ゆき</rt></ruby>

<ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby> is the town name. They had snow in April and it was not an uncommon thing. The town was covered in snow.

> <ruby>春<rt>はる</rt>休<rt>やす</rt>みが<rt></rt>昨日<rt>きの</rt>で<rt></rt>終<rt>お</rt>わり、<rt></rt>俺<rt>おれ</rt>はこの<rt></rt>日<rt>ひ</rt>から、<rt></rt>中学<rt>ちゅうがく</rt>二年生<rt>にねんせい</rt>になる</ruby>

What? <ruby>新見<rt>にいみ</rt>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was only 14 years old.

> <ruby>そして<rt></rt>何<rt>なに</rt>より<rt></rt>今日<rt>きょう</rt>は<rt></rt>妹<rt>いもうと</rt>、<rt></rt>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt>の<rt></rt>入学式<rt>にゅうがくしき</rt>。</ruby>

We have <ruby>石原<rt>いしはら</rt>舞<rt>まい</rt></ruby> to voice <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>. <ruby>石原<rt>いしはら</rt>舞<rt>まい</rt></ruby> had been streaming a lot of games lately.

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> was only a year younger than <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> so that was probably why she was so reversed to <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> became <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt>妹<rt>いもうと</rt></ruby> because her mother - <ruby>優子<rt>ゆうこ?</rt></ruby> - married his father. That event was 1 year before.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> called <ruby>優子<rt>ゆうこ</rt></ruby> as 優子さん. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s father's name is <ruby>恒一<rt>こういち?</rt></ruby>.

Great, others called the protagonist as <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>.

While the family was having breakfast, the news on the television announced that <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> - a professional skater had come back to the town (<ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby>). <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> referred <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> as <ruby>瑞<rt>みず</rt>ねぇ</ruby>.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> made a snowman to celebrate <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt>の<rt></rt>入学<rt>にゅうがく</rt></ruby> day.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XyLqhGC.png)

---

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> previously lived in a town called <ruby>樽倉<rt>たるくら</rt></ruby> which was 40 kilometers from their house. That day was the first time they go to school together (<ruby>登校<rt>とうこう</rt>する</ruby>). <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> played しりとり on their way to school.

When they came to the school front, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> received a メール and he was about to leave <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> alone. I guessed <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was going to <ruby>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>'s place. Nope, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> went to his mother's store. Her name is <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby>. <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby> had proper illustrations (poor 優子さん). <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby> looks like a very beautiful person. I wonder why did they divorce. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> helped まりあ by clearing the snow.

まりあ seemed to be very friendly toward <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>. I wonder how messy was their family relationship. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was late for the <ruby>入学式<rt>にゅうがくしき</rt></ruby> and he hadn't known which class he was in yet. The teacher told <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> to wait in a room. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> met a blonde hair girl there (third heroine appeared) - <ruby>転校生<rt>てんこうせい</rt>さん</ruby>.

From my experience with 月かな, the first option will contribute to this girl route. And those early choices often do not affect other heroines' routes.

```
x 挨拶する
  様子を見る
```

The girl did reply back and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> thought that she was good at <ruby>日本語<rt>にほんご</rt></ruby>. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> then started to talking to the girl but she seemed to be trouble and was having a hard time to reply.

> いっぱいの日本語···わからない

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> then used his broken English to say sorry but the girl seemed to not get it. The girl only understood that <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was introducing himself when <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> wrote his name in ローマ字 on his notebook. The girl name is Bethly Rose Daisley. I hope they would just use the English characters for Bethly's name instead of the stupid ローマ字 for the rest of the game. Nope, they refered Bethly as ベルリー.

It seemed <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and Bethly were in the same class. Their teacher came to guide them to the class.

> 先生も英語は苦手か

That sounds very harsh for Bethly. Come on Visual Arts', the best way to create an English speaking person who is not good at Japanese is to have them to speak fluent English that most Japanese cannot understand and have them to speak broken and weird Japanese that most Japanese cannot understand.

---

Bethly and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> introduced themselves to the class.

![](https://i.imgur.com/RlCdAHr.png)

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was the one sits next to <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. This was their first meeting.

Only <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> talked to Bethly during break time. As <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> taught Bethly about the word <ruby>納得<rt>なっとく</rt></ruby>, Bethly had been using it all the time which was a problem as she was using it wrong.

Bethly did not have any interests in 日本.

---

After school, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> came to meet <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>. <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> is a year older than <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and two of them seemed to know each others for a long time. <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> did not talk much during the first few minutes when they met each others (after a long time). <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> was shocked when <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> called her <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>先輩<rt>せんぱい</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> promised something with <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> before she went aboard in <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> (お嫁さんになります?).

---

While <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was waiting for <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> after school, he saw a first year girl and she knew <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s name.

![](https://i.imgur.com/9EtqrRQ.png)

The girl's name is <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby>. <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> is <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>'s classmate. <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> wanted to go home together with <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>. However, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> were about to go to まりあ's store. Three of them went there. The family did have to explain their family relationship to <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby>.

---

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> had dinner together. Their parents were late on that day.

The choices' meaning is so fuzzy. The second option looked like <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> would treat <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> as 妹 only.

```
  いいに決まってるだろ？
x もちろん、付き合うよ
```

__四月十二日（火曜日）__

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> asked <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> about <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>先輩</ruby>.

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was into <ruby>演劇<rt>えんげき</rt></ruby>. <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> lived in the <ruby>関東<rt>かんとう</rt></ruby> region before going to the current school. <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> talked about her <ruby>演劇<rt>えんげき</rt></ruby> hobby during her first year.

```
x 是非すぐに見せてほし
  いつか見せてほし
```

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> got to use a single <ruby>携帯<rt>けいたい</rt>カイロ</ruby> with Bethly and <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>. Bethly was a little embarrassed as all of their hands touched each others.

---

<ruby>放課後<rt>ほうかご</rt></ruby>

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>, <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> and <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> came to the skating ground. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> still called <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> using her last name and she was still annoyed by that. 二人まだ仲直りをした.

We had a flaskback about <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>, <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>, and <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby>.

---

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> remembered back about when she first met <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>.

---

__<ruby>四月<rt>よんがつ</rt>十四日<rt>じゅうよっか</rt>（<rt></rt>木曜日<rt>もくようび</rt>）</ruby>__

When <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was coming back to the classroom from the toilet, <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> was there and hugged him. <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> wanted to surprise <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> led <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> to an empty classroom and told him to get his clothes off. Oh, <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> wanted to fix a loosen button on <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s 制服.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> thanked <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> for fixing his clothes. <ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> then told <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> to call her as ヒナ from now on.

---

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> saw <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> go to the empty classroom. I guessed <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was there for practising <ruby>演劇<rt>えんげき</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was amazed by <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>'s acting.

```

__<ruby>四月<rt>よんがつ</rt>十五日<rt>じゅうごにち</rt>（<rt></rt>金曜日<rt>きんようび</rt>）</ruby>__

Bethly was having trouble with some dishes during <ruby>給食<rt>きゅうしょく</rt></ruby> and asked <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. I think Bethly was having trouble with unknown food.

```

---

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> realized what made <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> act strangely and came to her practising place to apologize.

```
x 俺も会いたかった

```

__<ruby>四月<rt>よんがつ</rt>十六日<rt>じゅうろくにち</rt>（<rt></rt>土曜日<rt>どようび</rt>）</ruby>__

<ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> was coming to <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s house (probably to play with <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>).

I wanted to meet some other heroine. My first priority was <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>.

```
x 牛乳を買いに行く

Nope, that was fast. No encounter happened.

When <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> brought the drink for <ruby>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby>, he heard <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt>のエロ声</ruby>.

<ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> was so focus on the マンガ and didn't notice that her パンツ was revealing.

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> sent <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> a note during class. It wrote:

---

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was going to eat outside that day. There was a restaurant that まりあ suggested the other day. Coincidencely, <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> was there. <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> seemed a little bit worried about her diet before eating.

I wanted to make <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> blush a little bit.

```

```

__04/22(金曜日)__

There was a beatiful teaching assistant that knew <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s mother - まりあ. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> led her to まりあ's store. They drank, sang, and played violin there.

__04/23(土曜日)__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> blackmailed ももちゃん先生 for something.

__04/25(月曜日)__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was luring <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> into his ultimate harem plan.

```
x 雪月にも参加してほしいんだ
  嫌だったら、無理にとは言わないけど
```

__04/26(火曜日)__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was making "poster" for his "harem plan" but his drawing is terrible. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> got Bethly to draw and found out that Bethly was good at drawing. Bethly's mother was an artist. However, she had already passed away.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> looked up about Bethly's mother that night.

__04/27(水曜日)__

It was <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>'s turn to be lured into <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s "harem plan".

```
x もう少し粘ってみる

```

__05/04(水曜日)__

<ruby>蒼井<rt>あおい</rt>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> did decide to participate in <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s "harem plan" even though she was not sure what she was going to do there.

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> considered to participate in the <ruby>ワンルーム<rt>one room</rt>学級<rt>がっきゅう</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>'s coach saw <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s flyer that <ruby>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> was crying with and got her to talk about it.

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> left a thank you note on <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s clothes while he was taking a bath.

Bethly looked at her mother paintings with her dad. Bethly had flashback about her mother and she were playing under the snow together.

__05/07(金曜日)__

Bethly hadn't gone back to school after Golden Week.

__05/09__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> asked ももちゃん先生 to see whether she knew anything about why Bethly hadn't not gone to school.

ゴメン、椛.

```
x 気になります
  違いますよ
```

ももちゃん先生 revealed that Bethly's father is a pilot. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was finding reason to come to see Bethly at her house.

__05/10__

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> got permission to come to Bethly's house. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> then came to Bethly's house. They met Bethly's dad - Brian. It seemed that Bethly was not going to show herself. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> invited Brian to まりあ's store.

まりあ, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> made some pancakes for Bethly before Brian came home. Bethly realized <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt>の<rt></rt>下手<rt>へた</rt>な<rt></rt>絵<rt>え</rt></ruby> that he drew on the pancakes.

__05/12(木曜日)__

Bethly came to school that day. Bethly thanked <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> for the pancake at the other day. That was the first time <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> saw Bethly smiles.

__05/13(金曜日)__

All the heroines went to the <ruby>ワンルーム<rt></rt>学級<rt>がっきゅう</rt></ruby> thing. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> talked about some mountain. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> also got Bethly to talk about Canada and her mother.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and Bethly went to home together that day (with some other people). Please stop using your broken English.

__05/15(日曜日)__

It seemed that the group would climb the mountain that <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> presented at the <ruby>ワンルーム<rt></rt>がっきゅう<rt></ruby> the other day. <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> was too excited for it so she didn't have much sleep the night before. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> helped <ruby>優子<rt>ゆうこ</rt></ruby> make <ruby>弁当<rt>べんとう</rt></ruby> for the trip that day. They made enough for 7 people (雪兎 (1), <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> (2), <ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> (3), <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> (4), Bethly (5), <ruby>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> (6), ももちゃん先生 (7)).

---

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> were the first ones to be at the gathering location. <ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> was being ナンパ.

The 彼女 option sounded fun.

```
x 俺の彼女がどうかしましたか？

<ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> was only being asked for direction by two foreigners.

It seemed that Bethly would not come. The six of them went on their trip without Bethly.

Bethly was already on the snow mountain and making a <ruby>小<rt>ちい</rt>さな<rt></rt>雪<rt>ゆき</rt>だるま</ruby> alone. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> only found her after hearing her "くちゅんっ". Could anyone just fix Bethly's "<ruby>納得<rt>なっとく</rt></ruby>".

<ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> presented at the <ruby>ワンルーム<rt></rt>学級<rt>がっきゅう</rt></ruby>. She called <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> two days before and asked for suggestion.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was the one to teach/introduce <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> to skating. <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> was very shy when she first met <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> but she opened to him like a few minutes later when he brought her to the park.

It would be <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>'s turn in the next <ruby>ワンルーム<rt></rt>学級<rt>がっきゅう</rt></ruby> that day. Everyone was amazed by <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>'s acting. They would about to perform a [play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)).

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> went to <ruby>商店街<rt>しょうてんがい</rt></ruby> to brought the equipments. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> "deceived" <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> into coming to his house. The restaurant that <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> came to before, was <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>'s house. The two became neighbors.

まりあ teased <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> when he brought <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> to the store.

<ruby>雛多<rt>ひたな</rt></ruby> was driving off the script. I would be mad if someone messed up the script on the stage. It would end up pretty bad. Bad <ruby>雛多<rt>ひたな</rt></ruby>.

They came to まりあ's store that night to celebrate. I think this would be the end of the <ruby>ワンルーム<rt></rt>学級<rt>がっきゅう</rt></ruby> arc.

The opening movie rolled out. <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> seemed to be the one with the most screen time. <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> had become so beautiful in highschool (in the OP).

__06/08(水曜日)__

The day started at <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s house where he and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> were preparing to go to school. That day was too warm but they still "have to" wear the winter <ruby>制服<rt>せいふく</rt></ruby> until June 20th.

Middle-school pool arc?

Yep, cleaning pool arc was coming. Our good boy <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> volunteered to clean the school pool. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was going to drag all the heroines with him. <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> and Bethly were going to be <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s first victims. Yep, <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was the first one to get caught.

<ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> might have to clean the school pool as she was texting so much about it on LIME.

__06/11(土曜日)__

That day was the pool cleaning day. It seemed that nobody who had to clean the pool, came except for <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>.

> <ruby>体育<rt>たいいく</rt>教師<rt>きょうし</rt>:　やられた</ruby>

Who would be the first to come and "rescue" <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>? It was Bethly.

Bethly got change in front of <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. Well, Bethly probably wore <ruby>水着<rt>みずぎ</rt></ruby> under her <ruby>制服<rt>せいふく</rt></ruby>. Sorry writers, I just read/watched too much. It is not your fault.

Please fix Bethly's <ruby>納得<rt>なっとく</rt></ruby>! How many chapters had passed?
