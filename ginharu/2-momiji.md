Oh. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> would call each others by their first names.

__05/28 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

椛 decided to stay at まりあ's store with 雪兎 a little bit longer after the party had ended.

__06/02 - 木曜日 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

For some reason, <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was at まりあ store (in the morning?) ... with <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. They were studying together. It seemed that 椛 asked 雪兎 to help her.

椛 was getting along with まりあ. They also had plan to visit 椛's family.

__07/15 - 金曜日 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

雪兎 and 椛 spent the summer together? They had gotten really close with each others.

__08/06 - 土曜日 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

椛 was about to have a trip back to her hometown. 椛 called 雪兎 to tell him about that and asked if he wants anything.

__10/13 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

<ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt>の<rt></rt>誕生日<rt>たんじょうび</rt></ruby> was coming up. It was 10/21.

椛 thought 雪兎 was about to kiss her to stop her from telling まりあ and ももちゃん先生 what 雪兎 just said about them.

__11/25 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

The group was about to perform an act again on Chrismas Eve. 椛 felt awkward around 雪兎 lately.

椛 gave 雪兎 her present (That day was 雪兎の誕生日).

__01/22 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

__01/23 - 月曜日 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

__08/02 - <ruby>中学三年<rt>ちゅうがくさんねん</rt></ruby>__

雪兎 and まりあ went outing with 椛's family. まりあ and 椛's mother were drunk and left the two kids alone.

雪兎 and 椛 were about to graduate. They had a lot of free time at school to hang out together. They spent their time in a <ruby>人気<rt>にんき</rt>のない<rt></rt>教室<rt>きょうしつ</rt></ruby>.

# Momiji School Arc

__03/04 - <ruby>高校一年<rt>こうこういちねん</rt></ruby>__

雪兎 did not come to wake 椛 up during that year winter (anymore)? 雪兎 wanted to see <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt>の<rt></rt>可愛<rt>かわい</rt>い<rt></rt>寝顔<rt>ねがお</rt></ruby> soon. Nope, 雪兎 was still come to 椛's house everyday during winter to wake her up. 椛 woke up early that day and was waiting for 雪兎. 雪兎 seemed to wake 椛 up by kissing her (everyday?). 椛 looked lovely in her 制服 with coat and scarf. Without the coat and scarf, that 制服 design looked pretty lame. 雪兎 and 椛 belonged to <ruby>演劇部<rt>えんげきぶ</rt></ruby> in high school. 雪兎 got quite tall since last arc.

New character!!!

<ruby>馴染<rt>なじ</rt>みの<rt></rt>深<rt>ふか</rt>い<rt></rt>女子生徒<rt>じょしせいと</rt></ruby>

Her name was <ruby>朱音<rt>あかね</rt></ruby>. 椛 called her as <ruby>朱音<rt>あかね</rt>ちゃん</ruby>. And 雪兎 referred her as <ruby>榊<rt>さかき?</rt></ruby>.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lIfvD8p.png)

<ruby>榊<rt>朱音<rt>あかね</rt></ruby> was the <ruby>演劇部<rt>えんげきぶ</rt>の<rt></rt>部長<rt>ぶちょう</rt></ruby>. She did not have a boyfriend.

雪兎 and 椛 were flirting with each others all the time.

椛's mother's name was <ruby>美花<rt>みか?</rt></ruby>.

__04/08 - <ruby>月曜日<rt>げつようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

It was only a month since the last scene.

椛 and 雪兎 were also not in the same class that year. 椛 looked very <ruby>不満<rt>ふまん</rt></ruby>. <ruby>榊<rt>さかき</rt>朱音<rt>あかね</rt></ruby> was in the same class with 椛　that year. ベルリー got into the same class with 雪兎.

Bethly stayed at ももちゃん place during her student exchange period in this route.

__05/03 - <ruby>金曜日<rt>きんようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

雪兎 and 椛 went a date that day. They all knew that they were going to have sex that day. Because of that, they were so nervous during their date. When 雪兎 and 椛 came to the 公園 for 花見, the flowers still hadn't bloomed. That sounded a little awkward as that was the "main" reason for their date that day. 椛 was trying her best to hide her 不安 during their date. 雪兎 was thinking about 椛 too much to the point that he didn't remember much about their conversation during their date.

雪兎 invited 椛 to his room. そして、エッチしました。

__05/07 - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

椛 and 雪兎 had a lot of sex during the last 4 days. 椛 and 雪兎 did it from morning till evening in one day. <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆづき</rt></ruby> seemed to hear 椛's and 雪兎's voice while they were having sex as 椛 was pretty loud.

__05/15 - <ruby>高校三年<rt>こうこうさんねん</rt></ruby>__

<ruby>榊<rt>さかき</rt>朱音<rt>あかね</ruby> pointed out that 雪兎 was doing everything for 椛のため. Because of that, 雪兎 started to consider what was his goal (without 椛). I think 雪兎 will struggle to deal with this problem.

__09/22 - <ruby>高校三年<rt>こうこうさんねん</rt></ruby>__

椛 decided change the script even though there was only a month left. 椛 would have the single week left to complete the new script. I wonder how would 雪兎 support 椛 in this mess. I think this event would change their relation a lots.

椛 herself cried about her crazy idea on 雪兎 afterward.

__09/25 - <ruby>高校三年<rt>こうこうさんねん</rt></ruby>__

椛 was acting very strange and clumsy lately. It seemed that 椛 was trying her best to write the new script.

![](https://i.imgur.com/sBZ3wD5.png)

椛 collapsed during <ruby>練習<rt>れんしゅう</rt></ruby>. Luckily, 雪兎 was there to support 椛 before she falled on the ground. It seemed 椛 was reaching her physical and mental limit. Everyone in the <ruby>演劇部<rt>えんげきぶ</rt></ruby> forced 椛 to rest for the day. <ruby>親切<rt>しんせつ</rt>な<rt></rt>仲間<rt>なかま</rt>たちね</ruby>. 雪兎 then carried 椛 on his back to the <ruby>保健室<rt>ほけんしつ</rt></ruby>. 雪兎 and <ruby>榊<rt>さかき</rt>朱音<rt>あかね</rt></ruby> were going to help 椛 with the new script.

雪兎 was kind of black out. 雪兎's vision was filled with まりあ's store. 雪兎 got an idea to "merge the last three scenes". It seemed that they were going to use the old script. 雪兎 was going use まりあ's violin for something? まりあ was playing the song コイイロセイカイ. However, that <ruby>曲<rt>きょく</rt></ruby> did not have any <ruby>歌詞<rt>かし</rt></ruby>. 雪兎 was going to write <ruby>歌詞<rt>かし</rt></ruby> for that <ruby>曲<rt>きょく</rt></ruby>.

__09/26 - <ruby>土曜日<rt>どようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校三年<rt>こうこうさんねん</rt></ruby>__

雪兎 did not produce any <ruby>歌詞<rt>かし</rt></ruby> that day.

__09/27 - <ruby>日曜日<rt>にちようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校三年<rt>こうこうさんねん</rt></ruby>__

雪兎 came to まりあ for advices. まりあ then told 雪兎 about her イメージ when she made that <ruby>曲<rt>きょく</rt></ruby>. <ruby>恋<rt>こい</rt>と<rt></rt>芽吹<rt>めぶ</rt>き</ruby>.

__10/12 - <ruby>高校三年<rt>こうこうさんねん</rt></ruby>__

大会の当日

They were <ruby>最優秀賞<rt>さいゆうしゅうしょう</ruby> (first place locally?).

__12/03 - <ruby>高校三年<rt>こうこうさんねん</rt></ruby>__

雪兎 and 椛 were going to take exam for college. I have no idea what 雪兎 was talking about. <ruby>幸<rt>しあわ</rt>せの<rt></rt>形<rt>かたち</rt>を<rt></rt>伝<rt>つた</rt>えられる<rt></rt>人間<rt>にんげん</rt>になりたい</ruby>?

雪兎 saw that 椛 was going to 東京大学.

__12/24 - <ruby>高校三年<rt>こうこうさんねん</rt></ruby>__

![](https://i.imgur.com/8qoEdI4.png)

雪兎 decided to attend college at 東京 with 椛.

雪兎 gave 椛 a ring as Chrismas present.

# Momiji After

__02/20 - 3 year(s) after high school__

雪兎 was wating for 椛 at the airport. Nope, 雪兎 and 椛 were waiting for their luggage. It had been around half a year since the last time they came back to <ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby>. 雪兎 and 椛 brought a lot of <ruby>お<rt></rt>土産<rt>みやげ</rt></ruby> with them.

It seemed that 雪兎 and 椛 had graduated from their university.

椛 received a phone call. That sounded like job-related stuffs. <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt>の<rt></rt>脚本<rt>きゃくほん</rt></ruby> has been selected or something likes that. Nope, 椛 got a job to write <ruby>脚本<rt>きゃくほん</rt></ruby> (for a show?).

椛's hair had grown over her shoulders. とても綺麗です. 雪兎 and 椛 got into small fight with each others about little things more often than during high school.

雪兎 and 椛's parents were worried about 椛's job as <ruby>脚本家<rt>きゃくほんか</rt></ruby>. I love how toneworks put their own professional experience in these works. 椛 herself was also worried about her career.

__2023/02/21__

__2023/10/21__

That day was 椛の誕生日.

<ruby>榊<rt>さかき</rt>朱音<rt>あかね</rt></ruby> invited 椛 to join <ruby>朱音<rt>あかね</rt>の<rt></rt>舞台<rt>ぶたい</rt></ruby>. 雪兎 told 椛 to come back to <ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby> together to help 椛 achieve her dream. 雪兎 and 椛 were going to graduate college around six months later. 椛 was really happy when 雪兎 told her about coming back to <ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby>. 椛 then rushed 雪兎 to come back to their home together in order to give her "the best present" of the day.

__2024/03/27__

雪兎 and 椛 moved back to <ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby>. 椛 and 雪兎 brought/rented an apartment/house. <ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> brought some 酒 as present for 雪兎 and 椛's new house.

__2024/03/29__

椛 and 雪兎 came to talk with 朱音 about her 舞台. 雪兎 appeared as a musician in this title. 奏汰 in つきかな was a writer.

朱音 and 椛 asked 雪兎 to do quite a lot of things (e.g. create a website, make musics, etc.).

椛 seemed to love alcohol.

After 朱音 left, drunken 椛 changed into <ruby>看護師<rt>かんごし</rt></ruby> costume and had sex with 雪兎.

__2024/06/03__

雪兎 got an office job since April and 椛 worked at a clothing store. They needed to earn some money for their 舞台 that they had talked with 朱音 since March.

椛 was not very good with <ruby>料理<rt>りょうり</rt></ruby>. 椛's first 弁当 for 雪兎 during college was a disaster.

雪兎 was doing his best to support their life at <ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby>.

__2024/07/02__

雪兎 had gotten quite busy lately.

__2024/10/01__

A 先輩 at 雪兎's workplace mentioned <ruby>独立<rt>どくりつ</rt></ruby> while chatting with 雪兎. I wonder if this was about 雪兎 was (emotionally) relying on 椛. Oh, the 先輩 was talking about starting one own's business.

__2024/10/03__

After fixing the mess that 雪兎 himself made at work, 雪兎 headed over to holoholo to meet up with 朱音 and 椛.

__2024/11/01__

雪兎, 椛, and 朱音 met up with other people in the 舞台.

__2024/12/10__

椛 welcomed 雪兎 home with a キス.

__2024/12/11 - 木曜日__

雪兎 felt heavy in the moring. It seemed that 雪兎 got sick. 椛 was very firm about forcing 雪兎 to rest for that day. 椛 was also prepare everything to get 雪兎 checked at the <ruby>病院<rt>びょういん</rt></ruby>. It was the first time 雪兎 saw 椛 being worried and mad like that. It was also the first time that 椛 took care of 雪兎 while he was sick.

雪兎 woke up at 2AM in the living room and felt very well. 椛 was sleeping beside 雪兎. 椛、お疲れ.

__2024/12/12 - 金曜日__

When 雪兎 came home at night, 椛 looked very tired. It seemed that 椛 caught 雪兎's cold from taking care of him the day before. 椛 also said that it was no big deal when 雪兎 said he was going to bring her to the hospital.

__2024/12/16 - 火曜日__

雪兎 and 椛 was planing for their date on Chrismas.

__2024/12/24__

椛 and 雪兎 was having a date on Chrismas Eve day. They were about to have some beer. Uh, I really hate alcohol.

It was about 10 years since 椛 and 雪兎 had known each others in that class.

__2025/01/02 - 金曜日__

__2025/01/04__

__2025/01/20__

<ruby>劇団<rt>げきだん</rt>の<rt></rt>名前<rt>なまえ</rt>は<rt></rt>メイプルノート<rt>maple note / 椛音</rt></ruby>.

__2025/02/12__

__2025/03/18__

__2025/03/20__

One <ruby>演者<rt>えんじゃ</rt></ruby> dropped out the day before their performance because that person's dad had health problem. At this rate, they wouldn't able to perform in the following day. 椛 was going to take up the missing role. 椛 and 朱音 asked 雪兎 to replace 椛's role while 椛 was going on the stage.

__2025/03/21 - 土曜日__

Something went wrong while 朱音 and 椛 were on the stage. I think 雪兎 was trying to fix it. The パネル (panel?) was moving not as intended and 雪兎 was trying to stop it before the light came back? 雪兎 decided to skip (that) scene. Luckily, 椛 and 朱音 were able to deal with it. The performance ended peacefully.

__2025/03/23 - 月曜日__

<ruby>劇団<rt>げきだん</rt>たち</ruby> celebrated their successful performance. Even though 椛 was drunk, she still realized 雪兎 was having some thoughts and asked 雪兎 to tell her.

雪兎 told 椛 to wait a little bit longer (for the proposal?).

# after a year (?)

It should be "a year later". toneworks, please hire a native English speaker.

__2026/02/06__

__2026/02/14__

雪兎 told 椛 that he wanted to leave his office job. 雪兎 worried that he would not able to support 椛 and himself if he quits the office job.

__2026/02/24__

朱音 called 雪兎 out to talk about 雪兎's プロポーズみたいな that 朱音 heard from 椛. I think 朱音 was mad about why 雪兎 didn't propose and marry 椛 but only プロポーズみたいなこと.

__2026/03/05__

The <ruby>劇団<rt>げきだん</rt></ruby>'s next performance would be about <ruby>花嫁<rt>はなよめ</rt></ruby>.

雪兎 deceived 椛 to get 椛 to go home first. 雪兎 and 朱音 were planing something and not letting 椛 knows. Everyone expect for 椛 came to まりあ's store for 朱音's plan about 雪兎 and 椛. Even <ruby>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>, <ruby>雛多<rt>ひなた</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> also came.

__2026/09/20__

雪兎 and 椛 filled out the <ruby>婚姻届<rt>こんいんとどけ</rt></ruby>. 椛の涙が出した気がする.

__2026/10/16 - 金曜日__

朱音 represented <ruby>劇団員<rt>げきだんいん</rt></ruby> to give 椛 birthday present which contained a bunch of <ruby>エロ<rt></rt下着<rt>したぎ</rt>や<rt></rt>衣装<rt>いしょう</rt></ruby>. Everyone left 椛 and 雪兎 alone before 椛 opened the present. 椛 was so embarrassed when she opened the present.

> 椛 - えっと···せっかくだから、これ今日、使う？

__2026/10/21 - 木曜日__

椛 and 雪兎 held 椛's birthday party at their house with only two of them that year.

__2026/11/21__

椛 invited 雪兎 on a date that day. She got tickets to watch a performace from a 舞台 from 朱音. After that, 椛 and 雪兎 came to the HORO🙂RO place where 雪兎 "confessed" to 椛 in <ruby>中学時代<rt>ちゅうがくじだい</rt></ruby>.

椛 gave 雪兎 his early birthday present (<ruby>スケジュール<rt></rt>帳<rt>ちゅう</rt></ruby>). 椛 had already written something in there.

__2026/12/19__

I would love to see 朱音 hook up with 雪兎 during 椛 route (ハーレム?).

__2026/12/24__

Just how much was 椛's love for <ruby>酒<rt>さけ</rt></ruby>? It's bad for your health, 椛.

When the performance ended, the girls stripped 椛 off to put her in the "wedding" dress. 椛 hadn't known that her wedding was about to be hold.

> 椛 - な、なに···？え、どうしてそんあ格好してるの···？

![](https://i.imgur.com/qS69NsP.png)

> 椛 - わたしを···っ！あなたのお嫁さんに、してくださいっ···！
