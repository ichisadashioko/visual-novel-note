<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> chose <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> the the following turn. Poor Bethly.

For some reason, <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> turned to ももちゃん先生's team. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> were the only two on their team after <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> left.

Oh. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> would call each others by their first names.

__05/28 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

椛 decided to stay at まりあ's store with 雪兎 a little bit longer after the party had ended.

__06/02 - 木曜日 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

For some reason, <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was at まりあ store (in the morning?) ... with <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. They were studying together. It seemed that 椛 asked 雪兎 to help her.

椛 was getting along with まりあ. They also had plan to visit 椛's family.

__07/15 - 金曜日 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

雪兎 and 椛 spent the summer together? They had gotten really close with each others.

__08/06 - 土曜日 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

椛 was about to have a trip back to her hometown. 椛 called 雪兎 to tell him about that and asked if he wants anything.

__10/13 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

<ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt>の<rt></rt>誕生日<rt>たんじょうび</rt></ruby> was coming up. It was 10/21.

椛 thought 雪兎 was about to kiss her to stop her from telling まりあ and ももちゃん先生 what 雪兎 just said about them.

__11/25 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

The group was about to perform an act again on Chrismas Eve. 椛 felt awkward around 雪兎 lately.

椛 gave 雪兎 her present (That day was 雪兎の誕生日).

Bethly was more <ruby>大胆<rt>だいたん</rt></ruby> than <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby>.

__01/22 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

__01/23 - 月曜日 - <ruby>中学二年<rt>ちゅうがくにねん</rt></ruby>__

That was the first day they came back to school after the 冬休み.

雪兎 and まりあ went outing with 椛's family. まりあ and 椛's mother were drunk and left the two kids alone.

雪兎 and 椛 were about to graduate. They had a lot of free time at school to hang out together. They spent their time in a <ruby>人気<rt>にんき</rt>のない<rt></rt>教室<rt>きょうしつ</rt></ruby>.

# Momiji School Arc

__03/04 - <ruby>高校一年<rt>こうこういちねん</rt></ruby>__

雪兎 did not come to wake 椛 up during that year winter (anymore)? 雪兎 wanted to see <ruby>椛<rt>もみじ</rt>の<rt></rt>可愛<rt>かわい</rt>い<rt></rt>寝顔<rt>ねがお</rt></ruby> soon. Nope, 雪兎 was still come to 椛's house everyday during winter to wake her up. 椛 woke up early that day and was waiting for 雪兎. 雪兎 seemed to wake 椛 up by kissing her (everyday?). 椛 looked lovely in her 制服 with coat and scarf. Without the coat and scarf, that 制服 design looked pretty lame. 雪兎 and 椛 belonged to <ruby>演劇部<rt>えんげきぶ</rt></ruby> in high school. 雪兎 got quite tall since last arc.

New character!!!

<ruby>馴染<rt>なじ</rt>みの<rt></rt>深<rt>ふか</rt>い<rt></rt>女子生徒<rt>じょしせいと</rt></ruby>

Her name was <ruby>朱音<rt>あかね</rt></ruby>. 椛 called her as <ruby>朱音<rt>あかね</rt>ちゃん</ruby>. And 雪兎 referred her as <ruby>榊<rt>さかき?</rt></ruby>.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lIfvD8p.png)

<ruby>榊<rt>朱音<rt>あかね</rt></ruby> was the <ruby>演劇部<rt>えんげきぶ</rt>の<rt></rt>部長<rt>ぶちょう</rt></ruby>. She did not have a boyfriend.

雪兎 and 椛 were flirting with each others all the time.

椛's mother's name was <ruby>美花<rt>みか?</rt></ruby>.

__04/08 - <ruby>月曜日<rt>げつようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

It was only a month since the last scene.

椛 and 雪兎 were also not in the same class that year. 椛 looked very <ruby>不満<rt>ふまん</rt></ruby>. <ruby>榊<rt>さかき</rt>朱音<rt>あかね</rt></ruby> was in the same class with 椛　that year. ベルリー got into the same class with 雪兎.

Bethly stayed at ももちゃん place during her student exchange period in this route.

__05/03 - <ruby>金曜日<rt>きんようび</rt></ruby> - <ruby>高校二年<rt>こうこうにねん</rt></ruby>__

雪兎 and 椛 went a date that day. They all knew that they were going to have sex that day. Because of that, they were so nervous during their date. When 雪兎 and 椛 came to the 公園 for 花見, the flowers still hadn't bloomed. That sounded a little awkward as that was the "main" reason for their date that day. 椛 was trying her best to hide her 不安 during their date. 雪兎 was thinking about 椛 too much to the point that he didn't remember much about their conversation during their date.

雪兎 invited 椛 to his room. そして、エッチしました。
