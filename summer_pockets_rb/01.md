# プロローグ

<ruby>羽依里<rt>はいり</rt></ruby> got voiced in this release.

I had already choose `傷ついた渡り鳥` in the first release. I was inexperience at that time and I didn't go back to play other route since the beginning. I was only following a certain routes guide when I played the first release. (School at that time was really depressing when I discovered that I can read quite a lot of Japanese but I still had to do all the basic paper practices.)

羽依里 got off the <ruby>船<rt>ふね</rt></ruby> and smell the disgusting smell of fish.

羽依里 missed the bus and he had to walk under the annoying hot summer weather now.

How the heck that 羽依里 had never come to his grandma place for his 17 years long.

> <ruby>...<rt></rt>二人<rt>ふたり</rt>で<rt></rt>世界中<rt>せかいじゅう</rt>を<rt></rt>旅行<rt>りょこう</rt>して...</ruby>

Just how rich are these people?

羽依里 used to participle in swimming. However, he failed a certain swimming competition (大会) and got scared of swimming.

羽依里 found his grandma house and met <ruby>鏡子<rt>きょうこ</rt></ruby> - his aunt.

羽依里 got tired of walking while coming here and slept till the evening.

---

What does <ruby>鏡子<rt>きょうこ</rt></ruby> eat every day? I have never seen her eat anything with 羽依里.

<ruby>鏡子<rt>きょうこ</rt></ruby> can't make any dinner for <ruby>羽依里<rt>はいり</rt></ruby> so she gave him some money and a motorcycle (CUP) for eating out and exploring the <ruby>島<rt>しま</rt></ruby> while he was there for the summer.

I am not sure why there are these "meaningless" choices. It confuses me as I don't know how it will affect the story. And I feel annoying when I have to choose. Just put a single stop for choosing the heroines.
