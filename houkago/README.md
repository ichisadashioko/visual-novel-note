## First route options

I wanted to encounter <ruby>陽佳<rt>ようか</rt></ruby> and the hint for her is <ruby>オシャレな<rt></rt>場所<rt>ばしょ</rt>の<rt></rt>周辺<rt>しゅうへん</rt></ruby>.

### First attempt

```
学園前の通り - 陽佳
オシャレ街 - ignored
分かれ道 - ignored
学生のたまり場 - ignored
```

#### 学園前の通り

We met 陽佳 and ミサち here.

I think the point of this game is to go outside after school and talk to people if you want to find a girlfriend or make friends. As said, I will call them over.

Going home together with two girls is really akward (for both キヨ and me). One of them is our childhood friend who キヨ didn't talk to for years and the other is her friend. From their looks, we would think that they are into fashionable things which we have absolutely no experience and interest about. I would just go home after school.

When they came to the station, ミサち decided to go to カラオケ with 陽佳 (for 30 minutes before her part-time shift). 陽佳 invited キヨ but he declined. We just went home there. It seems that those options if for <ruby>清史朗<rt>きよしろ</rt></ruby> to run and search for the first encounter. I am sure he must have teleportation ability.
