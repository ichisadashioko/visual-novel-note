# PROLOGUE 01

The game started at <ruby>陽佳<rt>ようか</rt></ruby>'s home where 陽佳母 was preparing <ruby>朝食<rt>ちょうしょく</rt></ruby> which had <ruby>納豆<rt>なっとう</rt></ruby>.

> 陽佳: いや···毎日毎日これって嫌なんだけど···

陽佳 got bored of having the same thing everyday and 納豆. And it was because 陽佳母 was lazy to make complicated dishes in the morning. 陽佳母 mentioned <ruby>清史朗<rt>きよしろ</rt></ruby> was moving back to this place. 陽佳母 told 陽佳 to pick 清史朗 up after school as he moved back that day.
