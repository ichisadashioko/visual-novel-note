This is my second play. I lost track of most the previous choices. I remembered that I was not honest with <ruby>妃愛<rt>ひより</rt></ruby> about my interest in other girls' photos. And I was trying to pursuing <ruby>常磐<rt>ときわ</rt>華乃<rt>かの</rt></ruby> route so I think I went out with her when she embarrassed herself.

The school exam is coming. <ruby>錦<rt>にしき</rt>あすみ</ruby> is having trouble with her study. <ruby>妃愛<rt>ひより</rt></ruby> offers to help <ruby>錦<rt>にしき</rt>あすみ</ruby>. However, <ruby>妃愛<rt>ひより</rt></ruby> also asks <ruby>智宏<rt>ともひろ</rt></ruby> to help her with studying. <ruby>鎌倉<rt>かまくら</rt>詩桜<rt>しお</rt></ruby> points out that <ruby>智宏<rt>ともひろ</rt></ruby> will not able to help <ruby>妃愛<rt>ひより</rt></ruby> seriously as he will <ruby>甘<rt>あま</rt>やかす</ruby> her.

I got <ruby>妃愛<rt>ひより</rt></ruby> route last time with <ruby>アテナイ<rt></rt>式<rt>しき</rt></ruby> choice so I will choose <ruby>スパルタ<rt></rt>式<rt>しき</rt></ruby> this time.

On the way home, <ruby>妃愛<rt>ひより</rt></ruby> is worrying about that she hasn't participated in any of the <ruby>生徒会<rt>せいとかい</rt></ruby>'s activities during <ruby>当日<rt>とうじつ</rt></ruby> including the following <ruby>サッカーの<rt></rt>応援<rt>おうえん</rt></ruby> event.

I think we have already gotten into <ruby>鎌倉<rt>かまくら</rt>詩桜<rt>しお</rt></ruby> route as she is teaching <ruby>和泉<rt>いずみ</rt>智宏<rt>ともひろ</rt></ruby> and rewarding him every times he solves a problem. ミリ interrupted their studying session. Poor <ruby>智宏<rt>ともひろ</rt></ruby>, he only needs one more button.

# `!?`

Yes, `!?` is the name of the chapter based on the save entry.

I think Madosoft originally intented to have all the sub heroines routes included but they weren't able to make it because of the 2020 event. All the sub heroines are well developed through out the common route.

# <ruby>この<rt></rt>紋所<rt>もんどころ</rt>が<rt></rt>目<rt>め</rt>に<rt></rt>入<rt>はい</rt>らぬか</rt>

Things has gotten pretty good with <ruby>常磐<rt>ときわ</rt>華乃<rt>かの</rt></ruby> and <ruby>鎌倉<rt>かまくら</rt>詩桜<rt>しお</rt></ruby>.

All the heroines reveal their professions with each others in this chapter.
