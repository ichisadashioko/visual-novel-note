What? Name customization? The dialog is going to be very awkward. If it is not, I would appriciate all the 声優たち who did twice the work for the intended experience (the default name). 

The protagonist's name (default name) is <ruby>新見<rt>にいみ</rt>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. I hope that the dialog will use this default name instead of あなた or きみ.

<ruby>二年生<rt>にねんせい</rt>A<rt></rt>組<rt>ぐみ</rt></ruby> (sound like the top class of his grade - A class)

<ruby>平成<rt>へいせい</rt>14年11月25月</ruby> (nope there was no 日 character there - TODO learn about Japanese imperial calendar system)

__四月十一日__

> <ruby>...<rt></rt>銀色<rt>ぎんいろ</rt>の<rt></rt>雪<rt>ゆき</rt></ruby>

<ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby> is the town name. They had snow in April and it was not an uncommon thing. The town was covered in snow.

> <ruby>春<rt>はる</rt>休<rt>やす</rt>みが<rt></rt>昨日<rt>きの</rt>で<rt></rt>終<rt>お</rt>わり、<rt></rt>俺<rt>おれ</rt>はこの<rt></rt>日<rt>ひ</rt>から、<rt></rt>中学<rt>ちゅうがく</rt>二年生<rt>にねんせい</rt>になる</ruby>

What? <ruby>新見<rt>にいみ</rt>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was only 14 years old.

> <ruby>そして<rt></rt>何<rt>なに</rt>より<rt></rt>今日<rt>きょう</rt>は<rt></rt>妹<rt>いもうと</rt>、<rt></rt>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt>の<rt></rt>入学式<rt>にゅうがくしき</rt>。</ruby>

We have <ruby>石原<rt>いしはら</rt>舞<rt>まい</rt></ruby> to voice <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>. <ruby>石原<rt>いしはら</rt>舞<rt>まい</rt></ruby> had been streaming a lot of games lately.

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> was only a year younger than <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> so that was probably why she was so reversed to <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> became <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt>妹<rt>いもうと</rt></ruby> because her mother - <ruby>優子<rt>ゆうこ?</rt></ruby> - married his father. That event was 1 year before.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> called <ruby>優子<rt>ゆうこ</rt></ruby> as 優子さん. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>'s father's name is <ruby>恒一<rt>こういち?</rt></ruby>.

Great, others called the protagonist as <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>.

While the family was having breakfast, the news on the television announced that <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> - a professional skater had come back to the town (<ruby>幌路<rt>ほろろ</rt></ruby>). <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> referred <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> as <ruby>瑞<rt>みず</rt>ねぇ</ruby>.

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> made a snowman to celebrate <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt>の<rt></rt>入学<rt>にゅうがく</rt></ruby> day.

<ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> previously lived in a town called <ruby>樽倉<rt>たるくら</rt></ruby> which was 40 kilometers from their house. That day was the first time they go to school together (<ruby>登校<rt>とうこう</rt>する</ruby>). <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> played しりとり on their way to school.

When they came to the school front, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> received a メール and he was about to leave <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby> alone. I guessed <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was going to <ruby>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>'s place. Nope, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> went to his mother's store. Her name is <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby>. <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby> had proper illustrations (poor 優子さん). <ruby>桧崎<rt>ひざき</rt>まりあ</ruby> looks like a very beautiful person. I wonder why did they divorce. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> helped まりあ by clearing the snow.

まりあ seemed to be very friendly toward <ruby>雪月<rt>ゆずき</rt></ruby>. I wonder how messy was their family relationship. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was late for the <ruby>入学式<rt>にゅうがくしき</rt></ruby> and he hadn't known which class he was in yet. The teacher told <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> to wait in a room. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> met a blonde hair girl there (third heroine appeared) - <ruby>転校生<rt>てんこうせい</rt>さん</ruby>.

From my experience with 月かな, the first option will contribute to this girl route. And those early choices often do not affect other heroines' routes.

```
x 挨拶する
  様子を見る
```

The girl did reply back and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> thought that she was good at <ruby>日本語<rt>にほんご</rt></ruby>. <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> then started to talking to the girl but she seemed to be trouble and was having a hard time to reply.

> いっぱいの日本語···わからない

<ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> then used his broken English to say sorry but the girl seemed to not get it. The girl only understood that <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> was introducing himself when <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> wrote his name in ローマ字 on his notebook. The girl name is Bethly Rose Daisley. I hope they would just use the English characters for Bethly's name instead of the stupid ローマ字 for the rest of the game. Nope, they refered Bethly as ベルリー.

It seemed <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and Bethly were in the same class. Their teacher came to guide them to the class.

> 先生も英語は苦手か

That sounds very harsh for Bethly. Come on Visual Arts', the best way to create an English speaking person who is not good at Japanese is to have them to speak fluent English that most Japanese cannot understand and have them to speak broken and weird Japanese that most Japanese cannot understand.

Bethly and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> introduced themselves to the class.

<ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> was the one sits next to <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby>. This was their first meeting.

Only <ruby>名白<rt>なしろ</rt>椛<rt>もみじ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> talked to Bethly during break time. As <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> taught Bethly about the word <ruby>納得<rt>なっとく</rt></ruby>, Bethly had been using it all the time which was a problem as she was using it wrong.

Bethly did not have any interests in 日本.

After school, <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> came to meet <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby>. <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> is a year older than <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> and two of them seemed to know each others for a long time. <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> and <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> did not talk much during the first few minutes when they met each others (after a long time). <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> was shocked when <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> called her <ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>先輩<rt>せんぱい</rt></ruby>.

<ruby>如月<rt>きさらぎ</rt>瑞羽<rt>みずは</rt></ruby> promised something with <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> before she went aboard in <ruby>雪兎<rt>ゆきと</rt></ruby> (お嫁さんになります?).
